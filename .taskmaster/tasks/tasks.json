The baseline audit report is comprehensive (530 lines, not 401 as stated in the user request, but close). Let me generate the update text for the subtask details:\n\n**Subtask 1.4 successfully completed with comprehensive deliverables:**\n\n**Primary Deliverable - Schema_Documentation_Baseline_Audit.md (530 lines):**\nLocated at reports/Schema_Documentation_Baseline_Audit.md, this comprehensive audit report establishes the complete documentation baseline for all 28 database tables. The report provides:\n\n**1. Executive Summary with Quality Tier System:**\n- 5-tier quality classification system (Exemplary, Comprehensive, Good, Adequate, Minimal)\n- 3 tables (11%) at Tier 1 exemplary standard: Individuals.md (641 lines), ActivityStudyItemIndividuals.md (412 lines), Cycles.md (458 lines)\n- 7 tables (25%) at Tier 2 comprehensive level requiring minor enhancements\n- 11 tables (39%) at Tier 3 good level needing depth expansion\n- 6 tables (21%) at Tier 4 adequate level requiring significant work\n- 1 table (4%) at Tier 5 minimal level needing complete rewrite: Activities.md (134 lines) - identified as critical priority P0\n\n**2. Complete Table Assessment (Lines 30-116):**\nDetailed analysis of all 28 tables with current line counts (range: 134-641 lines), quality tier assignments, and specific gap analysis for each table. Total baseline documentation: 9,168 lines across all schema files.\n\n**3. Technical Findings from Database Introspection (Lines 117-169):**\nComplete schema metadata captured including column names, data types, nullable constraints, character lengths, default values, and primary/foreign key relationships. Identified common field patterns across tables: audit fields (CreatedTimestamp, CreatedBy, LastUpdatedTimestamp, LastUpdatedBy), data migration fields (ImportedTimestamp, ImportedFrom, GUID, LegacyId, InstituteId), and display/actual date patterns. Data type distribution analysis with 89 bigint fields, 76 uniqueidentifiers, 143 datetime fields, and 98 boolean flags.\n\n**4. Business Context from Guidance Documents (Lines 170-230):**\nAnalyzed 9 foundational documents totaling ~2.6 MB: uhj_framework_action_messages.txt (947 KB, 1,293 concept mentions), uhj_turning_point_1996-2006.txt (920 KB, 1,277 mentions), itc_building_momentum.txt (76 KB), itc_attaining_dynamics_growth.txt (138 KB, 400 mentions), itc_institutes_attaining_higher_level.txt (89 KB, 334 mentions), and five-year/nine-year plans (433 KB combined, 487 mentions). Mapped critical domain concepts to database tables including core activities (ActivityType 0/1/2), participant roles (Role values 1/3/5/7), institute process, cluster development stages, geographic hierarchy, and statistical cycles. Established terminology glossary with 12 key terms for consistent usage.\n\n**5. Documentation Standard Template (Lines 232-342):**\nComprehensive 9-section template defining 350-600 line target documentation standard based on exemplary tables Individuals.md and ActivityStudyItemIndividuals.md. Required sections: (1) Overview 100-300 words with business context, (2) Table Structure comprising 50% of content with detailed per-field documentation format including purpose statement, business context 1-2 paragraphs, usage patterns, validation rules bullets, and special considerations, (3) Key Relationships 5-10% documenting all foreign keys bidirectionally, (4) Common Query Patterns 10-15% with minimum 5 practical SQL examples each including use case and performance notes, (5) Business Rules and Constraints 5%, (6) Data Quality Considerations 5%, (7) Performance Optimization 5%, (8) Integration and Synchronization 5%, (9) Notes for Developers 2-3%. Target metrics: 8-15 lines average per field, 5-10 query examples per table, all 9 sections complete.\n\n**6. Progress Tracking Matrix (Lines 343-391):**\nComplete 28-table tracking matrix (lines 346-376) with columns for table name, current lines, current tier, target lines, status indicators (🟢 Complete, 🟡 Enhance, 🟠 Expand, 🔴 Critical), and priority assignments (P0 Critical for 1 table, P1 High for 5 tables, P2 Medium for 12 tables, P3 Low for 7 tables). Matrix identifies 3 complete tables, 7 needing enhancement, 17 requiring expansion, and 1 critical rewrite. Priority system clearly defined with Activities.md flagged as P0 immediate priority requiring expansion from 134 to 500+ lines.\n\n**7. Recommended Implementation Sequence (Lines 392-458):**\nFour-phase roadmap: Phase 1 Critical Foundation (Tasks 2-3, 2-3 estimated tasks) covers Activities.md P0 rewrite, geographic hierarchy table expansion (Clusters, Localities), and curriculum table enhancement (StudyItems, ActivityStudyItems). Phase 2 Core Enhancement (Tasks 4-6, 3-4 tasks) addresses contact/individual support tables, reporting/statistics, and remaining geographic tables. Phase 3 System Administration (Tasks 7-8, 2-3 tasks) completes import/migration tables and dynamic list management system. Phase 4 Quality Assurance (Tasks 9-11, 2-3 tasks) performs cross-reference validation, comprehensive indexing, and privacy/security review.\n\n**8. Success Metrics (Lines 459-480):**\nQuantitative targets: increase tables at Tier 1 standard from 3 (11%) to 28 (100%), raise average lines per table from 327 to 450, grow total documentation from 9,168 to 12,600+ lines (73% to 100%), increase query examples from 3.8 to 7+ average, achieve 9/9 sections complete for all tables. Seven qualitative goals defined including comprehensive business context, consistent terminology, bidirectional relationship documentation, privacy considerations, performance guidance, integration patterns, and complete glossary integration.\n\n**Documentation Template Format Established:**\nThe template section (lines 232-342) provides the exact markdown structure and formatting requirements that all enhanced documentation must follow, with specific field documentation format example showing Header 3 level for field names, purpose statement, detailed business context paragraphs with guidance document references, usage patterns paragraph, validation rules as bullets, and special considerations covering privacy, performance, and migration. Query pattern format defined with SQL code blocks, use case explanations, and performance notes for each example.\n\n**Tracking System Implementation:**\nProgress tracking matrix enables systematic monitoring of documentation enhancement work across all 28 tables with clear status indicators, priority assignments based on business importance and current documentation quality, and specific target line counts for each table. System supports the recommended 4-phase implementation sequence by grouping tables according to priority and logical dependencies.\n\n**Tools and Resources Section (Lines 481-496):**\nDocuments available tools for implementation: db-tool/src/query-db.ts commands (introspect, query, tables), guidance/ directory with 9 foundational documents for business context, and template references pointing to Individuals.md and ActivityStudyItemIndividuals.md as gold standards.\n\n**Next Actions Roadmap (Lines 497-524):**\nImmediate action (Task 2) identified as Activities.md complete rewrite to P0 priority requiring expansion to 500+ lines. Short-term actions (Tasks 3-6) and medium-term actions (Tasks 7-11) clearly defined with specific deliverables for each phase.\n\n**Implementation Ready:**\nAll prerequisites for Tasks 2-11 now complete. Documentation standard template provides exact format requirements. Progress tracking matrix identifies all 28 tables with clear status and priorities. Business context from 9 guidance documents integrated. Database introspection metadata captured. Ready to begin Task 2 (Activities.md enhancement) immediately.\n</info added on 2025-11-18T18:15:16.453Z>",
