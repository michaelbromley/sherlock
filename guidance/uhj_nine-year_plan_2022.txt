The Nine Year Plan
2022-2031
Messages of the Universal House of Justice

At Riḍván this year we described how, over the course of a
quarter century, the Bahá’í world underwent a transformation
that endowed it with an undreamed-of capacity to learn, to
grow, and to serve humanity. But, however bright were the
achievements of this period, they must be eclipsed by what
is to come. By the conclusion of the new series of Plans
recently begun, the Bahá’í community will need to have
acquired capacities that can scarcely be glimpsed at present.
In your deliberations over the coming days, you will
be occupied with exploring what is required to bring
into being such a fortified community.

To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
We greet you with immense affection on this special
day, an occasion for calling to mind the power of the
Covenant, that power which “pulsateth in the body of the
contingent world” and forges enduring bonds of love among
the believers. In the months since Riḍván, we have seen the
evidences of this dynamic power in the unified activity
of Bahá’u’lláh’s followers, led so ably by the institutions
of the Cause in each continent and country, as the
friends everywhere have sought with characteristic
creativity and determination to minister to the needs
of an ailing world. Your resilience and your unwavering
commitment to the well-being of those around you,
persistent through all difficulties, have filled us with
tremendous hope. But it is no wonder that, in some
other quarters, hope has become a depleted resource.
There is a mounting realization on the part of the world’s
people that the decades ahead are set to bring with them
challenges among the most daunting that the human
family has ever had to face. The current global health crisis
is but one such challenge, the ultimate severity of whose
cost, both to lives and livelihoods, is yet unknown; your
efforts to succour and support one another as well
as your sisters and brothers in society at large will
certainly need to be sustained, and in places expanded.

1

1.1

1.2

It is against this background of furious storms
lashing humanity that the ark of the Cause is about
to embark upon a series of Plans that will carry it into
the third century of the Bahá’í Era and significantly
strengthen the Bahá’í community’s capacity for realizing
the society-building powers of the Faith. As you are
aware, the first Plan to commence this new series will
last but one year. In places where circumstances prevent
national communities from establishing as many intensive
programmes of growth before Riḍván 2021 as they
intended, these twelve months will extend the time
available to them to do so. Meanwhile, wherever the
process of growth has already been intensified, the year
will be an opportunity to consolidate the achievements
made during the current Plan, while cultivating the
conditions necessary for welcoming larger and larger
numbers of souls into the embrace of a community
recognized for its fortitude and outward-looking
orientation. At the national, regional, and cluster levels,
we look to communities of proven strength to help those
in which less experience has accrued. In this year-long
effort, every community must draw on whatever untapped
potential it may possess and seek to overcome any
obstacles that are impeding its growth, thereby
preparing it for the demands to come. For it is within
the context of a flourishing community, especially a
centre of intense activity in a village or neighbourhood,
and when each element of the Plan’s framework is
given the a�ention it requires, that those elements
most visibly cohere and connect, multiplying the
community’s powers in the field of action.

2

Besides providing for advances within clusters
everywhere, the coming Plan will be a year for profound
reflection on the life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the strength of
the Covenant of which He was the Centre, as the community prepares to commemorate the centenary of His
Ascension. The observance of this anniversary will
undoubtedly prompt individuals and communities alike
to contemplate the significance of that infinitely poignant
moment when He Who was the Mystery of God
departed from this world. His passing took from the
Bahá’ís of that era a Figure Who was the object of their
ardent love and loyalty; to the faithful of this age, He
remains without parallel: a perfect embodiment in word
and deed of all that His Father taught, the One through
Whom the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh was “proclaimed,
championed and vindicated”. We are conscious that
the coming year will also mark a century since His Will
and Testament—that “momentous”, “historic”, “immortal”
Document—“called into being, outlined the features
and set in motion the processes” of the Administrative
Order, “the very pa�ern of that divine civilization which
the almighty Law of Bahá’u’lláh is designed to establish
upon earth”. This “unique” and “divinely-conceived”
Order, this “mighty administrative structure”, had been
fashioned by its Architect to perpetuate the Covenant
and channel the spiritual powers of the Cause. It will be
apparent, then, that the Day of the Covenant next year,
exactly twelve months from now, will be especially
meaningful. We ask National Spiritual Assemblies to
determine how these two dates, occurring so close
together, may each be observed, taking into account
prevailing conditions in their countries.

3

1.3

1.4

All the while, earnest preparations continue to be
made in the Holy Land for the commemoration of the
centenary of the Ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at a gathering at which, it is hoped, representatives of National
Spiritual Assemblies and Regional Bahá’í Councils will
be present. Similarly, plans are already being made for
the conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors
and Auxiliary Board members, which will coincide, in
January 2022, with the lapse of one hundred years since
the first public reading of the Will and Testament of the
Master. Conditions in the world may, of course, require
the plans being made for these gatherings at the Bahá’í
World Centre to change. But come what may, we have
no doubt that the efforts made in local communities
worldwide to befi�ingly commemorate the Ascension
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and to honour the Day of the Covenant
in this coming centennial year will provide the impetus
needed to launch the succeeding stage in God’s Minor
Plan, even as Providence propels the unfoldment of His
Major Plan in accordance with His incontestable decree.

1.5

The momentum that is sure to build with each
successive cycle of the One Year Plan will be further
augmented by the release of two films. The first of these,
which will become available in time for the centennial
commemoration, will be a portrait of the Person of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Besides being a tribute to His life and
work, it will explore how, by championing the oneness
of humanity through His words and deeds, He offered
a challenge to the stale assumptions and prejudices of
the age, and gave stimulus to a process of unification
which continues to this day. A second film, following

4

soon after the first, will reflect on the expiration of
the first hundred years of the Formative Age from the
vantage point of the heights to which the Bahá’í community
has climbed, and from where it can now gaze upon
new horizons.
The significance of the occasions being marked
during the One Year Plan will lend it a unique character,
enhancing the work being undertaken in clusters and
making this single year the ideal preparation for the
global endeavour that is to follow. With a sense of joyful
anticipation, we announce that the Bahá’í world will, at
Riḍván 2022, begin a Nine Year Plan. Its requirements and
provisions will be set out at a later date, but its duration
already gives an unmistakable indication of the
expansive prospect it will present. God willing, it will
be heralded by the convocation of a series of conferences held over a span of months across the globe.

1.6

This, so far as it can be foreseen, is the course the
Bahá’í community will seek to tread. For the present
hour, we urge you to recommit your energies, keeping
your focus on the mission immediately before you. We
are immensely gratified to see the assured composure
with which the community of the Greatest Name has
sought to offer the divine remedy under all conditions,
especially during this period when society’s established
pa�erns of life have been disrupted and risks of different kinds are being faced by so many. Withal, the
friends must guard against being drawn into the ultimately futile conflict and strife that characterizes so
much of the discussion of the affairs of society, or—

1.7

5

heaven forbid—allowing interaction of this type to permeate, even fleetingly, the conversations of the community. Yet such vigilance on your part in avoiding discord
and in not becoming entangled in society’s controversies should under no circumstances be construed as
aloofness from the many pressing concerns of this time.
Far from it. You are among the most active and earnest
of humanity’s well-wishers. But, whether through deeds
or words, the merit of your every contribution to social
well-being lies, first, in your resolute commitment to
discover that precious point of unity where contrasting
perspectives overlap and around which contending
peoples can coalesce.
1.8

Less than two full cycles remain of the present Five
Year Plan—indeed, of the current series of Plans inaugurated in 1996. In these closing months, we will be sure to
offer ardent prayers on your behalf in our supplications
at the Sacred Threshold. May you succeed in giving
hope to those who know not where to find it in a world
disoriented and adrift, sorely lacking the unity which
you, through your heart-pledged devotion to the
Covenant, so conspicuously manifest.

Riḍván 2021

To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
The final words in a most memorable chapter in the
history of the Cause have now been wri�en, and the
page turns. This Riḍván marks the conclusion of an
extraordinary year, of a Five Year Plan, and of an entire
series of Plans that began in 1996. A new series of Plans
beckons, with what promises to be a momentous
twelve months serving as a prelude to a nine-year
effort due to commence next Riḍván. We see before us
a community that has rapidly gained strength and is
ready to take great strides forward. But there must be
no illusions about how much striving was required to
reach this point and how hard-won were the insights
acquired along the way: the lessons learned will shape
the community’s future, and the account of how they
were learned sheds light on what is to come.

2.1

The decades leading up to 1996, rich with advances
and insights of their own, had left no doubt that large
numbers of people in many societies would be ready to
enter under the banner of the Faith. Yet, as encouraging
as instances of large-scale enrolment were, they did not
equate to a sustainable process of growth that could be
cultivated in diverse se�ings. Profound questions faced
the community which, at that time, it had insufficient
experience to answer adequately. How could efforts

2.2

7

aimed at its expansion proceed hand in hand with the
process of consolidation and resolve the long-standing,
seemingly intractable challenge of sustaining growth?
How could individuals, institutions and communities
be raised up that would be capable of translating
Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings into action? And how could
those who were a�racted to the teachings become
protagonists in a global spiritual enterprise?

2.3

So it was that, a quarter of a century ago, a Bahá’í
community that could still count three Hands of the
Cause of God in its front ranks embarked on a Four
Year Plan, distinguished from those that came before it
by its focus on a single aim: a significant advance in the
process of entry by troops. This aim came to define the
series of Plans that followed. The community had
already come to understand that this process was not
just the entry into the Faith of sizeable groups, nor
would it emerge spontaneously; it implied purposeful,
systematic, accelerated expansion and consolidation.
This work would require the informed participation of
a great many souls, and in 1996, the Bahá’í world was
summoned to take up the vast educational challenge
this entailed. It was called to establish a network of
training institutes focused on generating an increasing
flow of individuals endowed with the necessary
capacities to sustain the process of growth.

2.4

The friends set about this task aware that, notwithstanding their previous victories in the teaching
field, plainly they had much to learn about which
capacities to acquire and, crucially, how to acquire

8

them. In many ways, the community would learn by
doing, and the lessons it learned, once they had been
distilled and refined by being applied in diverse
se�ings over time, would eventually be incorporated
into educational materials. It was recognized that
certain activities were a natural response to the
spiritual needs of a population. Study circles, children’s
classes, devotional meetings, and later junior youth
groups stood out as being of central importance in this
regard, and when woven together with related
activities, the dynamics generated could give rise to a
vibrant pa�ern of community life. And as the numbers
participating in these core activities grew, a new
dimension was added to their original purpose. They
came to serve as portals through which youth, adults
and whole families from the wider society could come
into an encounter with the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. It
was also becoming apparent how practical it was to
consider strategies for the work of community
building within the context of the “cluster”: a
geographic area of manageable size with distinct social
and economic features. A capacity for preparing
simple plans at the level of the cluster began to be
cultivated, and out of such plans, programmes for the
growth of the Faith arose, organized into what would
become three-month cycles of activity. An important
point of clarity emerged early on: the movement of
individuals through a sequence of courses gives
impetus to, and is perpetuated by, the movement of
clusters along a continuum of development. This
complementary relationship helped the friends
everywhere to assess the dynamics of growth in their

9

own surroundings and chart a path towards increased
strength. As time went on, it proved fruitful to view what
was occurring in a cluster both from the perspective of
three educational imperatives—serving children, junior
youth, and youth and adults—as well as from the
perspective of the cycles of activity essential to the
rhythm of growth. Part-way into a twenty-five-year
endeavour, many of the most recognizable features
of the growth process we see today were becoming
well established.

2.5

As the efforts of the friends intensified, various
principles, concepts and strategies of universal
relevance to the growth process began to crystallize
into a framework for action that could evolve to
accommodate new elements. This framework proved
fundamental to the release of tremendous vitality. It
assisted the friends to channel their energies in ways
that, experience had shown, were conducive to the
growth of healthy communities. But a framework is
not a formula. By taking into account the various
elements of the framework when assessing the reality
of a cluster, a locality, or simply a neighbourhood, a
pa�ern of activity could be developed that drew on
what the rest of the Bahá’í world was learning while
still being a response to the particulars of that place. A
dichotomy between rigid requirements on the one
hand and limitless personal preferences on the other
gave way to a more nuanced understanding of the
variety of means by which individuals could support a
process that, at its heart, was coherent and continually
being refined as experience accumulated. Let there be

10

no doubt about the advance represented by the
emergence of this framework: the implications for
harmonizing and unifying the endeavours of the entire
Bahá’í world and propelling its onward march were of
great consequence.
As one Plan succeeded another, and engagement
with the work of community building became more
broadly based, advances at the level of culture became
more pronounced. For instance, the importance of
educating the younger generations became more
widely appreciated, as did the extraordinary potential
represented by junior youth in particular. Souls
assisting and accompanying one another along a
shared path, constantly widening the circle of mutual
support, became the pa�ern to which all efforts aimed
at developing capacity for service aspired. Even the
interactions of the friends among themselves and with
those around them underwent a change, as awareness
was raised of the power of meaningful conversations to
kindle and fan spiritual susceptibilities. And significantly,
Bahá’í communities adopted an increasingly outwardlooking orientation. Any soul responsive to the vision
of the Faith could become an active participant—even
a promoter and facilitator—of educational activities,
meetings for worship and other elements of the
community-building work; from among such souls,
many would also declare their faith in Bahá’u’lláh.
Thus, a conception of the process of entry by troops
emerged that relied less on theories and assumptions
and more on actual experience of how large numbers
of people could find the Faith, become familiar with it,

11

2.6

identify with its aims, join in its activities and
deliberations, and in many cases embrace it. Indeed, as
the institute process was strengthened in region after
region, the number of individuals taking a share in the
work of the Plan, extending even to those recently
acquainted with the Faith, grew by leaps and bounds.
But this was not being driven by a mere concern for
numbers. A vision of personal and collective transformation occurring simultaneously, founded on study
of the Word of God and an appreciation of each
person’s capacity to become a protagonist in a
profound spiritual drama, had given rise to a sense of
common endeavour.

2.7

One of the most striking and inspiring features of
this twenty-five-year period has been the service
rendered by Bahá’í youth, who with faith and valour
have assumed their rightful place in the forefront of the
community’s efforts. As teachers of the Cause and
educators of the young, as mobile tutors and homefront
pioneers, as cluster coordinators and members of Bahá’í
agencies, youth on five continents have arisen to serve
their communities with devotion and sacrifice. The
maturity they have demonstrated, in the discharge of
duties upon which depends the advancement of the
Divine Plan, is expressive of their spiritual vitality and
their commitment to safeguarding humanity’s future. In
recognition of this increasingly evident maturity, we
have decided that, immediately following this Riḍván,
while the age at which a believer becomes eligible to
serve on a Spiritual Assembly shall remain twenty-one,
the age at which a believer may vote in Bahá’í elections

12

shall be lowered to eighteen. We have no doubt that
Bahá’í youth everywhere who are of age will vindicate
our confidence in their ability to fulfil “conscientiously
and diligently” the “sacred duty” to which every
Bahá’í elector is called.
We are conscious that, naturally, the realities
of communities differ greatly. Different national
communities, and different places within those
communities, began this series of Plans at different
points of development; since then, they have also
developed at different speeds and have a�ained
different levels of progress. This, in itself, is nothing
new. It has always been the case that conditions in
places vary, as does the degree of receptivity found
there. But we perceive, too, a swelling tide, whereby
the capacity, confidence and accumulated experience
of most communities are rising, buoyed by the success
of their sister communities near and far. As an
example, while souls who arose to open a new locality
in 1996 lacked nothing for courage, faith and devotion,
today their counterparts everywhere combine those
same qualities with knowledge, insights and skills that
are the accumulation of twenty-five years of effort by
the entire Bahá’í world to systematize and refine the
work of expansion and consolidation.

2.8

Regardless of a community’s starting point, it has
advanced the process of growth when it has combined
qualities of faith, perseverance and commitment with
a readiness to learn. In fact, a cherished legacy of this
series of Plans is the widespread recognition that any

2.9

13

effort to advance begins with an orientation towards
learning. The simplicity of this precept belies the
significance of the implications that follow from it. We
do not doubt that every cluster, given time, will
progress along the continuum of development; the
communities that have advanced most quickly,
relative to those whose circumstances and possibilities
were similar, have shown an ability to foster unity of
thought and to learn about effective action. And they
did so without hesitating to act.

2.10

A commitment to learning also meant being
prepared to make mistakes—and sometimes, of course,
mistakes brought discomfort. Unsurprisingly, new
methods and approaches were handled inexpertly at
first because of a lack of experience; on occasion, a
newly acquired capacity of one kind was lost as a
community became absorbed in developing another.
Having the best of intentions is no guarantee against
making missteps, and moving past them requires both
humility and detachment. When a community has
remained determined to show forbearance and learn
from mistakes that naturally occur, progress has never
been out of reach.

2.11

Midway through the series of Plans, the community’s
involvement in the life of society began to become the
focus of more direct a�ention. The believers were
encouraged to think of this in terms of two interconnected
areas of endeavour—social action and participation in
the prevalent discourses of society. These, of course,
were not alternatives to the work of expansion and

14

consolidation, much less distractions from it: they were
inherent within it. The greater the human resources a
community could call on, the greater became its
capacity to bring the wisdom contained in Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation to bear upon the challenges of the day—to
translate His teachings into reality. And the troubled
affairs of humankind over this period seemed to
underline how desperate was its need for the remedy
prescribed by the Divine Physician. Implied in all this
was a conception of religion very different from those
holding sway in the world at large: a conception which
recognized religion as the potent force propelling an
ever-advancing civilization. It was understood that
such a civilization would also not appear spontaneously,
of its own accord—it was the mission of Bahá’u’lláh’s
followers to labour for its emergence. Such a mission
demanded applying the same process of systematic
learning to the work of social action and engagement
in public discourse.
Viewed from the perspective of the last two and a
half decades, the capacity for undertaking social action
has risen markedly, leading to an extraordinary
efflorescence of activity. Compared with 1996, when
some 250 social and economic development projects
were being sustained from year to year, there are now
1,500, and the number of Bahá’í-inspired organizations
has quadrupled to surpass 160. More than 70,000
grassroots social action initiatives of short duration are
being undertaken each year, a fifty-fold increase. We
look forward to a continued rise in all these endeavours
resulting from the dedicated support and stimulus

15

2.12

now provided by the Bahá’í International Development
Organization. Meanwhile, Bahá’í participation in the
prevalent discourses of society has also grown immensely.
Besides the many occasions when the friends find they
can offer a Bahá’í perspective in conversations that occur
in a work or personal context, more formal participation
in discourses has significantly advanced. We have in
mind not only the much-expanded efforts and
increasingly sophisticated contributions of the Bahá’í
International Community—which in this period added
Offices in Africa, Asia and Europe—but also the work
of a vastly augmented, greatly fortified network of
national Offices of External Affairs, for whom this area
of endeavour became the principal focus; in addition,
there were insightful and notable contributions made by
individual believers to specific fields. All this goes
some way towards explaining the esteem, appreciation
and admiration which leaders of thought and other
prominent figures at all levels of society have again
and again expressed for the Faith, its followers and
their activities.

2.13

In reviewing the entire twenty-five-year period, we
are awed by the many kinds of progress the Bahá’í
world has made concurrently. Its intellectual life has
thrived, as demonstrated not only by its advances in all
the areas of endeavour already discussed, but also by
the volume of high-quality literature published by
Bahá’í authors, by the development of spaces for the
exploration of certain disciplines in the light of the
teachings, and by the impact of the undergraduate and
graduate seminars systematically offered by the

16

Institute for Studies in Global Prosperity, which, in
collaboration with the institutions of the Cause, now
serves Bahá’í youth from well over 100 countries.
Efforts to raise up Houses of Worship have very visibly
accelerated. The last Mother Temple was erected in
Santiago, Chile, and projects to build two national and
five local Mashriqu’l-Adhkárs were initiated; the
Houses of Worship in Ba�ambang, Cambodia, and
Norte del Cauca, Colombia, have already opened their
doors. Bahá’í Temples, whether newly dedicated or
long established, are increasingly occupying a position
at the heart of community life. The material support
offered by the rank and file of the believers for the
myriad endeavours undertaken by the friends of God
has been unstinting. Simply viewed as a measure of
collective spiritual vitality, the generosity and sacrifice
with which, at a time of considerable economic upheaval,
the critical flow of funds has been maintained—nay,
invigorated—is most telling. In the realm of Bahá’í
administration, the capacity of National Spiritual
Assemblies to manage the affairs of their communities
in all their growing complexity has been considerably
enhanced. They have benefited in particular from new
heights of collaboration with the Counsellors, who
have been instrumental in systematizing the gathering
of insights from the grassroots across the world and
ensuring they are widely disseminated. This was also
the period in which the Regional Bahá’í Council
emerged as a fully fledged institution of the Cause, and
in 230 regions now, Councils and those training
institutes they oversee have proved themselves
indispensable for advancing the process of growth. To

17

extend into the future the functions of the Chief
Trustee of Ḥuqúqu’lláh, the Hand of the Cause of God
‘Alí-Muḥammad Varqá, the International Board of
Trustees of Ḥuqúqu’lláh was established in 2005; today
it coordinates the efforts of no less than 33 National
and Regional Boards of Trustees that now compass the
globe, which in turn guide the work of over 1,000
Representatives. The developments which occurred at
the Bahá’í World Centre during this same period are
many: witness the completion of the Terraces of the
Shrine of the Báb and two buildings on the Arc and the
commencement of the construction of the Shrine of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, not to mention a host of projects to
strengthen and preserve the precious Holy Places of
the Faith. The Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and the Shrine of
the Báb were recognized as World Heritage sites,
places of inestimable significance for humanity. The
public flocked to these sacred locations in their
hundreds of thousands, approaching one and a half
million in some years, and the World Centre regularly
welcomed hundreds of pilgrims at once, sometimes
more than 5,000 in a year, along with a similar number
of Bahá’í visitors; we are delighted as much by the
raised numbers as by the scores of different peoples
and nations represented among those who partake of
the bounty of pilgrimage. The translation, publication
and dissemination of the Sacred Texts has also been
greatly accelerated, in parallel with the development of
the Bahá’í Reference Library, one of the most notable
members of the growing family of websites associated
with Bahai.org, which itself is now available in ten
languages. A variety of offices and agencies have been

18

established, situated at the World Centre and elsewhere,
charged with supporting the process of learning
unfolding across multiple areas of endeavour
throughout the Bahá’í world. All this, our sisters and
brothers in faith, is but a fraction of the tale we could
recount of what your devotion to Him Who was the
Wronged One of the World has brought forth. We can
but echo the poignant words once voiced by the
beloved Master when, overcome with emotion, He
cried out: “O Bahá’u’lláh! What hast Thou done?”

*
From the panorama of a pivotal quarter century,
we now direct our focus to the most recent Five Year
Plan, a Plan quite unlike any that has gone before in a
variety of ways. In this Plan we urged the Bahá’ís of the
world to draw on all that they had learned in the
previous twenty years and put it to full effect. We are
delighted that our hopes in this regard were more than
met, but while we would naturally expect great things
from the followers of the Blessed Beauty, the character
of what was achieved through their herculean efforts
was truly breathtaking. It was the capstone to an
accomplishment twenty-five years in the making.

2.14

The Plan was especially memorable for being trisected
by two sacred bicentenaries, each of which galvanized
local communities the world over. The company of the
faithful demonstrated, on a scale never previously
witnessed and with relative ease, a capacity to engage
people from all sections of society in honouring the life

2.15

19

of a Manifestation of God. It was a powerful indicator
of something broader: the ability to channel the release
of tremendous spiritual energies for the advancement
of the Cause. So magnificent was the response that in
many places the Faith was propelled out of obscurity at
the national level. In se�ings where it was unexpected,
perhaps unlooked for, marked receptivity to the Faith
became apparent. Thousands upon thousands upon
thousands were transported by their encounter with a
devotional spirit that is today characteristic of Bahá’í
communities everywhere. The vision of what is made
possible by observing a Bahá’í Holy Day was
immeasurably expanded.

2.16

The achievements of the Plan, simply in numerical
terms, quickly eclipsed those of all the Plans that had
preceded it since 1996. At the start of this Plan, the
capacity existed for conducting just over 100,000 core
activities at a given time, a capacity that was the fruit
of twenty years of common endeavour. Now, 300,000
core activities are being sustained at once. Participation
in those activities has risen above two million, which is
also close to a threefold increase. There are 329 national
and regional training institutes in operation, and their
capacity is evidenced by the fact that three-quarters of
a million people have been enabled to complete at least
one book of the sequence; overall, the number of
courses completed by individuals is now also two
million—a rise of well over a third in five years.

2.17

The increased intensity with which programmes of
growth around the world are being pursued tells an

20

impressive story of its own. In this five-year span, we
had called for growth to be accelerated in every one of
the 5,000 clusters where it had begun. This imperative
became the impetus for earnest endeavour throughout
the world. As a result, the number of intensive
programmes of growth more than doubled and now
stands at approximately 4,000. Difficulties involved in
opening up new villages and neighbourhoods to the
Faith in the midst of a global health crisis, or
expanding activities that were at an early stage when
the pandemic began, prevented an even higher total
from being reached during the Plan’s final year.
However, there is more to tell than this. At the outset of
the Plan, we had expressed the hope that the number
of clusters where the friends had passed the third
milestone along a continuum of growth, as a consequence
of learning how to welcome large numbers into the
embrace of their activities, would grow by hundreds
more. That total then stood at around 200, spread
across some 40 countries. Five years on, this number
has risen to an astonishing 1,000 in nearly 100
countries—a quarter of all the intensive programmes of
growth in the world and an achievement far surpassing
our expectations. And yet even these figures do not
reveal the loftiest heights to which the community has
soared. There are over 30 clusters where the number of
core activities being sustained exceeds 1,000; in places,
the total is several thousand, involving the
participation of more than 20,000 people in a single
cluster. A growing number of Local Spiritual Assemblies
now oversee the unfoldment of educational programmes
that cater to practically all the children and junior

21

youth in a village; the same reality is beginning to
emerge within a few urban neighbourhoods.
Engagement with the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh has, in
notable instances, transcended individuals, families
and extended kinships—what is being witnessed is the
movement of populations towards a common centre.
At times, age-old hostilities between opposing groups
are being left behind, and certain social structures and
dynamics are being transformed in the light of the
divine teachings.

2.18

We cannot but be overjoyed at advances so
impressive. The society-building power of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh is being manifested with ever more clarity,
and this is a firm foundation upon which the coming
Nine Year Plan will build. Clusters of marked strength,
as had been hoped, have proven to be reservoirs of
knowledge and resources for their neighbours. And
regions where more than one such cluster exist have
more easily developed the means to accelerate growth
in cluster after cluster. We feel compelled to stress
again, however, that progress has been near universal;
the difference in progress between one place and
another is of degree. The community’s collective
understanding of the process of entry by troops and its
confidence in being able to stimulate this process
under any set of circumstances have risen to levels that
were unimaginable in decades past. The profound
questions that had loomed for so long, and which were
brought into sharp focus in 1996, have been convincingly
answered by the Bahá’í world. There is a generation of
believers whose entire lives bear the imprint of the

22

community’s progress. But the sheer scale of what has
occurred in those many clusters where the frontiers of
learning are being extended has turned a significant
advance in the process of entry by troops into a
momentous one of historic proportions.
Many will be familiar with how the Guardian
divided the Ages of the Faith into consecutive epochs;
the fifth epoch of the Formative Age began in 2001.
Less well known is that the Guardian also made
specific reference to there being epochs of the Divine
Plan, and stages within those epochs. Held in abeyance
for two decades while local and national organs of
the Administrative Order were being raised up
and strengthened, the Divine Plan conceived by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was formally inaugurated in 1937 with
the commencement of the first stage of its first epoch:
the Seven Year Plan assigned by the Guardian to the
North American Bahá’í community. This first epoch
closed after the conclusion of the Ten Year Crusade in
1963, which had resulted in the banner of the Faith
being planted across the world. The opening stage of
the second epoch was the first Nine Year Plan, and no
less than ten Plans have followed in its wake, Plans that
have ranged in duration from twelve months to seven
years. At the dawn of this second epoch, the Bahá’í
world was already witnessing the earliest beginnings
of that entry into the Faith by troops that had been
foreseen by the Author of the Divine Plan; in the
succeeding decades, generations of devoted believers
within the community of the Greatest Name have
laboured in the Divine Vineyard to cultivate the

23

2.19

conditions required for sustained, large-scale growth.
And at this glorious season of Riḍván, how abundant
are the fruits of those labours! The phenomenon of
sizeable numbers swelling the activities of the
community, catching the spark of faith and swiftly
arising to serve at the leading edge of the Plan has
moved from being a forecast sustained by faith to a
recurring reality. Such a pronounced and demonstrable
advance demands to be marked in the annals of the
Cause. With elated hearts, we announce that the third
epoch of the Master’s Divine Plan has begun. Stage by
stage, epoch after epoch shall His Plan unfold, until the
light of the Kingdom illumines every heart.

*
2.20

Beloved friends, no review of the five-year enterprise
that concluded the second epoch of the Divine Plan
would be complete without special reference to the
upheavals that accompanied its final year and which
persist still. The restrictions on personal interaction
that waxed and waned in most countries over this
period could have dealt the community’s collective
efforts a severe blow, recovery from which might have
taken years, but there are two reasons why this was not
the case. One was the widespread consciousness of the
duty of Bahá’ís to serve humanity, never more so than
in times of peril and adversity. The other was the
extraordinary rise in capacity in the Bahá’í world to
give expression to that consciousness. Accustomed
over many years to adopting pa�erns of systematic
action, the friends brought their creativity and sense of

24

purpose to bear on an unforeseen crisis, while
ensuring that the new approaches they developed
were coherent with the framework they had laboured
in successive Plans to perfect. This is not to overlook
the serious hardships being endured by Bahá’ís, like
their compatriots in every land; yet throughout severe
difficulties, the believers have remained focused.
Resources have been channelled to communities
in need, elections went ahead wherever possible, and
in all circumstances the institutions of the Cause
have continued to discharge their duties. There have
even been bold steps forward. The National
Spiritual Assembly of São Tomé and Príncipe will be
re-established this Riḍván, and two new pillars of the
Universal House of Justice will be raised up: the
National Spiritual Assembly of Croatia, with its seat
in Zagreb, and the National Spiritual Assembly of
Timor-Leste, with its seat in Dili.
And so the One Year Plan begins. Its purpose and
requirements have already been set out in our message
sent on the Day of the Covenant; this Plan, though
brief, will suffice to prepare the Bahá’í world for the
Nine Year Plan that is to follow. A period of special
potency, which opened one hundred years after the
revelation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, will
soon close with the centenary of the Ascension of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, marking the conclusion of the first
century of the Formative Age and the start of the
second. The company of the faithful enter this new
Plan at a time when humanity, chastened by the
exposure of its vulnerability, seems more conscious of

25

2.21

the need for collaboration to address global challenges.
Yet, lingering habits of contest, self-interest, prejudice
and closed-mindedness continue to hinder the
movement towards unity, despite growing numbers in
society who are showing in words and deeds how
they, too, yearn for greater acceptance of humanity’s
inherent oneness. We pray that the family of nations
may succeed in pu�ing aside its differences in the
interests of the common good. Notwithstanding the
uncertainties that shroud the months aheade entreat
Bahá’u’lláh to make the confirmations that have
sustained His followers for so long more abundant
still, that you may be carried forward in your mission,
your composure undisturbed by the turbulence of a
world whose need for His healing message is ever
more acute.

2.22

The Divine Plan enters a new epoch and a new
stage. The page is turned.

To the Friends Gathered in the Holy Land
to Mark the Centenary Commemoration
of the Ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
Our hearts are filled with wonder as we contemplate the significance of this momentous occasion: the
close of one hundred years since the passing of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, one hundred years since the inception of
the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation, and one
hundred years since the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh was
entrusted to His Administrative Order, whose institutions you here represent. How marvellous is His
Covenant, through which “this unique, this wondrous
System” has been established in your nations and its
processes made to operate. We bow our heads in gratitude to Bahá’u’lláh that, despite the numerous and
severe obstacles of a world in turmoil, He has opened
the doors and facilitated the means for you—including, for the first time, representatives of Regional Bahá’í
Councils—to be here during these soul-stirring days.

3.1

A period of special potency which began in 2016
with the centenary of the revelation of the Tablets
of the Divine Plan and included the bicentennial
anniversaries of the Birth of the Twin Manifestations of
God is now, a hundred years after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
passing, drawing to a close. The advancements the
Bahá’í community has made during this time have

3.2

27

been nothing less than extraordinary. These have prepared the believers everywhere to meet the demands and
fulfil the requirements of the next stage of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Divine Plan, which is to commence just months from
now and will last nine years. The accelerating decline
of the current social order, and the growing need for
constructive processes that will lead to the emergence
of a new world society, are daily more evident. A century after the Master bequeathed to the followers of
the Greatest Name a document which contains priceless elements for building a divine civilization, we are
reminded of the words of the beloved Guardian: “The
champion builders of Bahá’u’lláh’s rising World Order
must scale nobler heights of heroism as humanity
plunges into greater depths of despair, degradation,
dissension and distress.”

3.3

Beloved friends, on this Day of the Covenant we all
look to its Centre and recall the life and Person of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a Figure Whose very being was the embodiment of the Covenant, that pivotal centre of unity
for all humankind, binding together the multitudinous
peoples of the earth. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that Mystery of
God, “a sign of His greatness”, and “the most perfect
bounty”, Who is treasured in the pure hearts of countless children, youth, and adults, is surely watching
over and aiding His loved ones, ever casting His eye of
protection over them. In these uncertain times, the
friends turn with hope and longing to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
that “shelter for all mankind”, “a shield unto all who
are in heaven and on earth”, beseeching His assistance
from the realms above as they endeavour to follow His

28

example in the path of service. During the coming
days, when the thoughts of the believers all around the
world are focused on “this sacred and glorious Being”,
you have the blessing and privilege of paying homage
to Him on behalf of your communities in those
very spots where He laboured day and night for
the promotion of the Cause of God and for the
betterment of humankind.
Tomorrow night, on the eve of the centenary of His
passing, we will hold His loved ones throughout the
world in our hearts as we pray in the sacred room
where the final moments of His earthly life were spent.
We will ardently supplicate that the healing message
for which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá lived and sacrificed His all
may, before long, find a home in the hearts and souls
of all humanity and that the efforts of the friends of
God to this end may be acceptable in His sight.

ON THE OCCASION OF THE CENTENARY
COMMEMORATION OF THE
ASCENSION OF ‘ABDU’L-BAHÁ
A Tribute by the Universal House of Justice
A century has now elapsed since the noble spirit of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá ascended to its eternal home. His birth
had coincided with the dawn of the Faith’s Heroic Age,
and His passing signalled the se�ing of the sun upon
its final epoch. No clearer demonstration could be
imagined of how He embodied the forces of unity than
the sight of His funeral, at which a vast crowd of
mourners from every creed in this land came together
to grieve their common loss. In His day, so many of the
friends who embraced the Faith absorbed the spirit of
the divine teachings simply by observing Him; still
today, if we wish to align our lives with that same
spirit, we look to the example set by the Master, Whose
word and deed reflected the brilliance of the light that
shone from Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation.

4.1

In every respect, His example is central to Bahá’í
identity. Every Bahá’í may turn to Him to understand
be�er how to diffuse the light of the Faith and for a
model to follow as we seek to awaken spiritual
susceptibilities in those we encounter. His own counsel, that the teacher must be “fully enkindled” so that

4.2

31

his u�erance may “exert influence”, and yet be “totally
self-effaced and evanescent” so that “he may teach
with the melody of the Concourse on high”, is vividly
realized in the unnumbered accounts of souls transformed by being in the company of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
Countless are the lessons to be learned from how He
presented the divine precepts to every kind of person,
constantly widening the circle of unity, without regard
for any outward dissimilarities of appearance, language,
custom, or belief. The universality of His love produced
a community that, even at that time, could justly claim
to be a cross-section of society. His love revived,
nurtured, inspired; it banished estrangement and
welcomed all to the banquet table of the Lord. Every
community-building endeavour undertaken today,
every educational activity and every outreach, carries
with it the hope of communicating, through our own
efforts, a token of the same love He showered upon
every soul. Such efforts are the best tribute that can
be rendered to Him, at this centenary and every
day that follows.

4.3

We offer thanks to Bahá’u’lláh for having given the
world not only, in His teachings, a standard of purity,
devotion, and integrity to which souls may forever
aspire, but also, in the Figure of the Master, a flawless
example of how life can be lived to that standard. As
humanity is beset by crisis after crisis, the community
of the Greatest Name, which cannot avoid exposure to
such upheavals, is privileged to have before it the
model of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Neither peril nor obstacle would
prevent Him from discharging His mission, whether

32

by a�ending to the needs of the hour or preparing for
the future; neither hostility nor events of the world
would divert Him from His course. Serene, confident,
and resolute, He was unperturbed by setbacks,
welcoming hardship and adversity in the path of God.
How relentless were the a�acks upon Him! How deplorable the burdens He had to bear! We recall the
testimony of His distinguished sister, the Greatest
Holy Leaf, that “in the dark of the night, out of the
depths of His bosom, could be heard His burning
sighs, and when the day broke, the wondrous music of
His prayers would rise up to the denizens of the realm
on high.”
The passage of time has not diminished the awe
with which we regard “the rôle and character of One
Who, not only in the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh but in
the entire field of religious history, fulfils a unique
function.” And as Shoghi Effendi has further affirmed
of Him:

4.4

He is, and should for all time be regarded, first
and foremost, as the Centre and Pivot of Bahá’u’lláh’s
peerless and all-enfolding Covenant, His most
exalted handiwork, the stainless Mirror of His light,
the perfect Exemplar of His teachings, the unerring Interpreter of His Word, the embodiment of every Bahá’í
ideal, the incarnation of every Bahá’í virtue, the Most
Mighty Branch sprung from the Ancient Root, the
Limb of the Law of God, the Being “round Whom all
names revolve”, the Mainspring of the Oneness of
Humanity, the Ensign of the Most Great Peace, the

4.5

33

Moon of the Central Orb of this most holy Dispensation—styles and titles that are implicit and find
their truest, their highest and fairest expression in
the magic name ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He is, above and beyond
these appellations, the “Mystery of God”—an expression
by which Bahá’u’lláh Himself has chosen to designate
Him, and which, while it does not by any means
justify us to assign to Him the station of Prophethood,
indicates how in the person of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
the incompatible characteristics of a human nature
and superhuman knowledge and perfection have
been blended and are completely harmonized.

4.6

Dearest co-workers: We summoned you here not
only to honour the memory of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and to
recall His trials and triumphs, but also, with us, to
rededicate yourselves and the communities you
represent to earnestly serving the Cause to which He
devoted His very existence. In fulfilment of the sacred
charge laid upon Him by the Blessed Beauty, He gave
the Bahá’í world custody of two Charters that have
guided its progress and development ever since. One
was His Tablets of the Divine Plan, through which the
Word of God has come to be promulgated in every
land; the other was His Will and Testament, which set
in motion a process for the establishment of the
Administrative Order. Now, at the close of the first
century of the Formative Age, and at the outset of a
new series of global Plans, the accelerating progress of
the Master’s Divine Plan is plain to see. And the organic
unfoldment of the Administrative Order over the last
hundred years is demonstrated by the existence of the

34

vast array of institutions and agencies, from the international level to the local, that channel the spirit of the
Faith and guide and support the efforts of the worldwide Bahá’í community. The Covenant of which
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was the Centre remains an impregnable
stronghold. We rejoice at how the Covenant orients
each believer towards a common mission, maintaining
a dynamic unity that cultivates a constantly growing
community of the faithful.
Contemplating the Person of the Master, we find
ourselves wonderstruck by the all-compassing authority
that accompanied His inexhaustible patience and
understanding, by the keenness of His wisdom in
every se�ing, by the infinite tenderness of His being,
and by His limitless love that can be felt by every
unshu�ered soul. But every prompting to pay homage to
His matchless qualities is restrained by the recollection
that never did He seek praise or worldly recognition.
And so we feel compelled to testify: Beloved of all our
hearts, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Your all was servitude—a servitude
“complete, pure and real, firmly established,
enduring, obvious, explicitly revealed and subject
to no interpretation whatever”. We reserve what
words remain for a pledge of fidelity to You, for our
vow to uphold the Covenant that You “proclaimed,
championed and vindicated”, for our wholehearted
expression of loyalty to Your timeless guidance and
expositions, to Your fervent entreaties and exhortations.
This same pledge is manifested in the steadfast,
strenuous exertions of the Bahá’í world to fulfil the
mission entrusted to it at this time. Seeing this

35

4.7

community striving to live by Your example summons
up for us these words of Yours:

4.8

O friends! Praise be to God that the banner of
Divine Unity hath been hoisted in every land, and
the melody of the Abhá Kingdom hath been raised
on every side. The holy Seraph of the Concourse on
high is raising the cry of “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” in the
midmost heart of the world, and the power of the
Word of God is breathing true life into the body of
existence.

4.9
Wherefore, O ye faithful friends, it behoveth
you all to join ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in self-sacrifice and in
service to the Cause of God and thraldom to His divine Threshold. If ye be aided to a�ain unto such a
supreme bounty, the whole world shall erelong be
made the recipient of the effulgent splendours of
God, and the longed-for oneness of humanity shall
be revealed in the utmost beauty and charm in the
midmost heart of the world. This is the dearest
wish of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! This is the greatest yearning
of them that are faithful! The Glory of Glories rest
upon you.

To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
As we reflect on the events which a few days ago
marked the centenary of the Ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
in the Holy Land, we feel impelled to express to you
our sense of wonderment at the exalted character of
what transpired. We offer praise and gratitude to the
Blessed Beauty that, despite current circumstances in
the world and the many restrictions on travel, nearly
six hundred representatives of the vast majority of
National Spiritual Assemblies and Regional Bahá’í
Councils were able to be present at the Bahá’í World
Centre for this historic occasion. The days of this
remarkable gathering were spent in profound
contemplation on the life and example of the
beloved Master, on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the Centre of
the Covenant, on His Will and Testament and the
unfoldment of the Administrative Order over the last
century, and on the extraordinary distance the Bahá’í
world has travelled through the implementation of His
Divine Plan. A spirit of consecration permeated the air
as those present prayed in the vicinity of His resting
place on the anniversary of the holy night of His
Ascension. The love of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá drew the souls to
the Mountain of the Lord, and they return to their
homes carrying the love of the Universal House of

37

5.1

Justice to the institutions they represent and to all the
friends of God.

5.2

We are confident that the spiritual forces generated
by this gathering will be diffused throughout your
communities and will inspire the friends as they
prepare themselves for the upcoming series of
worldwide conferences, which will launch the
Bahá’í world into the next stage of the Divine Plan.
To this end, we will offer our ardent prayers at
the Sacred Threshold.

To the Conference of the
Continental Boards of Counsellors
Dearly loved Friends,
At Riḍván this year we described how, over the
course of a quarter century, the Bahá’í world underwent a transformation that endowed it with an
undreamed-of capacity to learn, to grow, and to serve
humanity. But, however bright were the achievements
of this period, they must be eclipsed by what is to
come. By the conclusion of the new series of Plans
recently begun, the Bahá’í community will need to
have acquired capacities that can scarcely be glimpsed
at present. In your deliberations over the coming days,
you will be occupied with exploring what is required
to bring into being such a fortified community.

6.1

Bahá’u’lláh states that “the purpose for which
mortal men have, from u�er nothingness, stepped into
the realm of being, is that they may work for the
be�erment of the world and live together in concord
and harmony.” He has revealed teachings that make
this possible. Building a society that consciously pursues this collective purpose is the work of not only
this generation, but of many generations to come, and
Bahá’u’lláh’s followers welcome all who labour alongside them in this undertaking. It means learning how

6.2

39

to raise up vibrant, outward-looking communities; it
means those communities learning how to bring about
spiritual and material progress; it means learning how
to contribute to the discourses that influence the
direction of that progress. These areas of endeavour
are, naturally, familiar ones. Seen from one perspective,
they are quite distinct, each having its own characteristics and imperatives. Yet they all represent ways of
awakening the energies latent in the human soul and
channelling them towards the be�erment of society.
Together, they are means of releasing what the
Guardian described as “the society-building power” of
the Faith. This inherent power possessed by the Cause
of Bahá’u’lláh is visible even in the fledgling efforts of
a Bahá’í community learning to serve humanity and
promote the Word of God. And though the world
society foreshadowed in His Revelation is of course far
distant, communities that are earnestly learning to
apply His teachings to their social reality abound.
How immensely blessed are those souls who, alive to
the greatness of this Day and the significance of their
actions, strive for the emergence of a society shaped by
the divine teachings.

6.3

The series of global Plans that began at Riḍván will
last a full twenty-five years. It will carry the ark of the
Cause into the third century of the Bahá’í Era and
conclude at Riḍván 2046. During this period, the
Bahá’í world will be focused on a single aim: the
release of the society-building power of the Faith in
ever-greater measures. The pursuit of this overall aim
will require a further rise in the capacity of the

40

individual believer, the local community, and the institutions of the Faith. These three constant protagonists
of the Plan each have a part to play, and each one has
capacities and qualities that must be developed. However, each is incapable of manifesting its full potential
on its own. It is by strengthening their dynamic
relationships with one another that their powers are
combined and multiplied. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains that
the more the qualities of cooperation and mutual
assistance are manifested by a people, “the more will
human society advance in progress and prosperity”; in the Faith, this principle distinguishes and
shapes the interactions of individuals, institutions, and
communities, and it endows the body of the Cause
with moral vigour and spiritual health.
The enkindled souls being raised up through the
processes of the Plan are seeking to gain an ever more
profound understanding of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings—
“the sovereign remedy for every disease”—and to
apply them to the needs of their society. They are
commi�ed to the prosperity of all, recognizing that the
welfare of individuals rests in the welfare of society at
large. They are loyal citizens who eschew partisanship
and the contest for worldly power. Instead, they are
focused on transcending differences, harmonizing
perspectives, and promoting the use of consultation
for making decisions. They emphasize qualities and
a�itudes—such as trustworthiness, cooperation, and
forbearance—that are building blocks of a stable social
order. They champion rationality and science as essential for human progress. They advocate tolerance and

41

6.4

understanding, and with the inherent oneness of
humanity uppermost in their minds, they view
everyone as a potential partner to collaborate with,
and they strive to foster fellow feeling even among
groups who may traditionally have been hostile to one
another. They are conscious of how the forces of
materialism are at work around them, and their eyes
are wide open to the many injustices that persist in the
world, yet they are equally clear sighted about the
creative power of unity and humanity’s capacity for
altruism. They see the power that true religion
possesses to transform hearts and overcome distrust,
and so, with confidence in what the future holds,
they labour to cultivate the conditions in which
progress can occur. They share their beliefs
liberally with others, remaining respectful of the
freedom of conscience of every soul, and they
never impose their own standards on anyone.
And while they would not pretend to have discovered
all the answers, they are clear about what they
have learned and what they still need to learn.
Their efforts advance to the alternating rhythm
of action and reflection; setbacks leave them unfazed.
In places where growing numbers are helping
to build communities of this character, the power
of the Cause to transform people’s social existence,
as well as their inner lives, is becoming increasingly
visible. Earnest pursuit of the Plan’s central aim
will, we are sure, cause many, many such communities to emerge.

42

The movement of clusters
A greater expression of the society-building power
of the Faith requires, first and foremost, still further
advances in the process of entry by troops in every part
of the world. The essentially spiritual undertakings of
diffusing the light of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation ever
more widely and extending the roots of His Faith ever
more deeply into the soil of society have measurable
outcomes: the number of clusters where a programme
of growth has been initiated and the degree of intensity
that each has reached. The means now exist for a swift
advance in relation to both measures. The goal that the
community of the Greatest Name must aspire to fulfil
during the current series of global Plans is to establish
intensive programmes of growth in all the clusters
in the world. This formidable objective implies a
broadening and intensification of activity on a scale
never witnessed. Rapid progress towards this goal must
be achieved in the course of the Nine Year Plan.

6.5

As a preliminary step, we ask that you assist
National Spiritual Assemblies and Regional Bahá’í
Councils to determine whether their schemes for
dividing their territories into clusters would benefit
from any adjustments. As you know, a cluster defines
an area where the activities of the Plan can be
stimulated in a manageable and sustainable way.
Over the last twenty-one years, much has been learned
about the size of cluster that is “manageable” in
different contexts and in different parts of the world; in
some countries, modifications have already begun to

6.6

43

be considered, occasioned by the effects of growth. In
many instances this reassessment will not lead to any
change, but in some it will result in a cluster being
divided or reduced in size, and occasionally a cluster
might become larger. Areas that are sparsely populated owing to the natural terrain may be excluded
from the clustering scheme. Of course, any believers
who reside in such places would adopt as many
elements of the framework for action as are applicable
to their circumstances.

6.7

The movement of clusters along a continuum of
development will remain the basic model for the
expansion and consolidation of the community. The
features of the developmental path that should be
followed, and in particular the first, second, and third
milestones that mark progress along the way, are
already well known to the friends from our previous
messages and from their own experience, and we feel
no need to reiterate what we have stated before. By the
close of the One Year Plan we anticipate that programmes of growth will be under way in over 6,000
clusters, that in close to 5,000 of these the second milestone will have been passed, and that in 1,300 of these
the believers will have advanced further. These figures
must climb considerably over the coming nine years.
Once any adjustments to the clustering scheme in each
country have been determined, we ask that you work
with National Assemblies and Regional Councils to
forecast the numbers of clusters where progress could
be made past the first, second, and third milestones,
respectively, during the Plan. It should be borne in

44

mind that these are only intended to be well-informed
estimates; they can be refined later as necessary and
need not be laboured over at length. As such, we
request that the results of these assessments be sent to
the Bahá’í World Centre by Naw-Rúz. At Riḍván, we
will then be able to set out the total collective aspirations of the Bahá’í world for the Nine Year Plan.
We are conscious that there are some regions and
countries where the Faith remains at an early point of
development, and there is a pressing need to ensure
that what the Bahá’í world has learned about accelerating the growth process benefits these places as well.
One important lesson that has become clear is the
immense value, to a region, of a cluster where the third
milestone has been passed. Once the friends in a given
cluster have developed the range of capacities that such
progress implies, and the means to disseminate insights
and share experience about community-building
endeavours are in place, then a swift acceleration of the
work of expansion and consolidation in surrounding
clusters becomes possible. With this in mind, it is
imperative that during the Nine Year Plan the process
of growth reach this level of intensity in at least one
cluster in every country and every region. This constitutes one of the Plan’s chief objectives and it will call
for the concentrated effort of many a consecrated soul.
The International Teaching Centre is ready to work
with you to implement several strategies to bring this
about. Foremost among these will be the deployment
of teams of international and homefront pioneers who
are familiar with the framework for action and are

45

6.8

prepared to dedicate significant amounts of time and
energy to serving the Cause over a number of years.
You will need to impress upon National Spiritual
Assemblies and Regional Bahá’í Councils the urgency
of encouraging believers who, following in the footsteps of so many heroic souls of the past, can arise to
ensure that the light of the Faith shines bright in every
territory. We look in particular to countries, regions,
and clusters where strength and experience have
accumulated to generate a flow of pioneers to places
where help is needed, and also to provide support by
other means. This flow of support is one more way
in which the spirit of collaboration and mutual
assistance, so essential for progress, manifests itself
in systematic action.

6.9

The accomplishments of the previous series of
Plans—particularly the last Five Year Plan—could not
have occurred without a tremendous advance in the
teaching work. An important dimension of this work
is the capacity to engage in conversations on spiritual
themes, a capacity which was explored in our message
to your 2015 conference, where we described how it is
developed through participation in institute courses
and by gaining practical experience. It is evident that
the pa�ern of activity unfolding at the grassroots
opens up a variety of se�ings in which receptive
souls—sometimes whole families or peer groups—can
take part in meaningful conversations which awaken
interest in the vision of the Faith and the Person of
Bahá’u’lláh. Over time, many such souls begin to
identify themselves with the Bahá’í community,

46

especially as they gain the confidence to participate in
community life through service. Of course, the community welcomes any degree of association that a
person would like to maintain, great or small. Yet to
recognize Bahá’u’lláh as a Manifestation of God and
accept the privileges and responsibilities that are
uniquely associated with membership in the Bahá’í
community is a singular moment in a person’s spiritual
development, quite distinct from regular involvement
in Bahá’í activities or voicing support for Bahá’í
principles. Experience has shown that the environment
created by community-building endeavours in a
locality enables anyone who wishes to take this
step to do so with relative ease. Wherever these
endeavours are under way, it is important for the
friends to remain mindful that the doors of the Faith
are wide open and to give encouragement to those
who stand at the threshold. And in areas where such
endeavours have been well established for some time,
many believers are discovering that a vibrant, expanding pa�ern of activity can naturally lead to families,
groups of friends, and even clusters of households
being ready to enter the Cause. For in spaces where
the possibility of joining the community can be
discussed openly and inclusively among those who
share a sense of collective identity, souls can more
easily feel emboldened to take this step together.
Bahá’í institutions, especially Local Spiritual
Assemblies, must adopt a mindset that allows for
such developments, and ensure that any obstacles
are removed.

47

6.10

We ask you and your auxiliaries to help the
believers, wherever they reside, reflect periodically on
effective ways of teaching the Faith in their surroundings, and to fan within their hearts a passion for
teaching that will attract the confirmations of the
Divine Kingdom. Souls who have been given the
blessing of faith have a natural wish to share this
gift through conversations with relatives, friends,
classmates, co-workers, and those previously unmet,
seeking in every place and at every moment a hearing
ear. Different se�ings and circumstances lend themselves to different approaches, and the friends should
be occupied in an ongoing process of learning about
what is most effective in the place where they are.
Learning from the most advanced clusters

6.11

Six years ago we described for you the characteristics
of a cluster where the friends have passed the third
milestone along the continuum of growth. To have
come this far implies intense activity occurring in
specific neighbourhoods or villages, but also concerted
effort being made by the generality of the believers
living across the cluster—in other words, a rising spirit
of universal participation in the work of community
building. In practice, this means the mobilization of a
sizeable number of Bahá’ís who are creatively and
intelligently applying the Plan’s framework for action
to the reality of their own circumstances wherever in
the cluster they live. It entails families and individual
believers working together and making a conscious
decision to see themselves as belonging to an expand-

48

ing nucleus. Such groups of friends set about widening
the circle of participation in their activities by engaging
with the networks to which they belong—networks
created through a place of work or study, a local
school, or a community hub of another kind—and by
accompanying others who arise to serve alongside
them. These efforts have tremendous merit. Even
when a cluster contains a number of flourishing
centres of intense activity, efforts being made across
the rest of the cluster might still represent a large
proportion of all the activity that is occurring. We also
acknowledge, in this connection, the steps being taken
in some clusters to systematically reach out to a
specific population that has shown receptivity to the
Faith but is dispersed throughout the cluster. This can
be seen as a specialized form of the community-building work, and one which continues to show great
promise. As participation in the work of the Plan in all
its forms increases, many opportunities emerge for the
friends to learn from each other’s experience and to
kindle within one another the joy of teaching.
Of course, the work undertaken in receptive neighbourhoods and villages has been a special focus of
a�ention in recent years. As the inhabitants of such
locations begin to participate in Bahá’í activities in
large numbers, more consideration needs to be given
to coordination in order to cope with the inherent
complexity involved. Within each centre of intense
activity, collaborative arrangements emerge among
groups of families, who organize community-building
activities among themselves with a view to widening

49

6.12

the embrace of such activities to many nearby
households; an informal network of friends provides
encouragement and support to the endeavours under
way. The character of daily life in such places is adapting
to the rise of a culture in which worship and service are
cherished activities involving many people at once.
Uplifting, well-prepared community gatherings—
extending in some cases to camps and festivals—occur
with increasing frequency, and music and song feature
prominently on such occasions. Indeed the arts as
a whole, so integral a part of the development of a
community from the start, stand out in such se�ings as
an important means of generating joy, strengthening
bonds of unity, disseminating knowledge, and consolidating understanding, as well as of acquainting those
in the wider society with the principles of the Cause.
And naturally, there remains a strong focus on being
outward looking: finding ways to continually share
the fruits of a thriving pa�ern of action with souls who
are as yet unfamiliar with the Faith.

6.13

Amid all this, we have observed a specific, heartening phenomenon, whose early glimpses we described
in our message to your 2015 conference as representing
a new frontier. Although learning how to embrace
large numbers is a characteristic of any cluster where
the third milestone has been passed, the focus of the
friends necessarily begins to broaden as they approach
a point where a significant proportion of the population
of a particular area is taking part in communitybuilding activities. This might be true for only a
specific residential area in a cluster, or for several

50

such areas, or for a single village; other parts of the
cluster might not yet share the same reality. But in
such locations, the thoughts of the friends labouring at
the grassroots are increasingly occupied with the
progress and well-being of everyone dwelling in the
vicinity. Bahá’í institutions feel more keenly their
responsibility for the spiritual education of an entire
generation of children and junior youth, most or even
all of whom might already be engaged in community
activities. Local Spiritual Assemblies strengthen their
relationships with authorities and local leaders, even
entering into formal collaborations, and growing
a�ention is given to the multiplying initiatives of social
action arising from groups of junior youth, youth,
women, families, or others who are responding to the
needs around them. The sheer level and variety of
activity requires Auxiliary Board members to appoint
multiple assistants to serve a single village or
neighbourhood; each assistant might follow one
or more lines of action, offering counsel and
support as necessary, and lending momentum to the
processes in motion.
In places where the activities of the Plan have
reached such a degree of prevalence, the inhabitants
now possess a substantially increased capacity to
steer the course of their own development, and
the institutions and agencies of the Faith there now
have an expanded vision of their responsibilities. Of
course, these responsibilities still include having
robust systems in place to continually build capacity
and support those taking initiative. But the advance-

51

6.14

ment of the community depends, to a greater extent
than before, on local institutions and agencies being
conscious of the social forces at work in the environment
and acting to preserve the integrity of the community’s
many endeavours. Meanwhile, the relationship of
the Bahá’í community to the surrounding society
undergoes profound change. As represented by its
formal structures of administration and informal
collaborative arrangements, the Bahá’í community has
become a highly visible protagonist in society in its
own right, one that is ready to shoulder important
responsibilities and intensify a broad, collective process
of learning about spiritual and material progress. At the
same time, as the wider society embraces many aspects of
Bahá’í community life and imbibes its unifying spirit,
the dynamics thus created allow divers groups to
come together in a combined movement inspired by
Bahá’u’lláh’s vision of the oneness of humanity. To
date, the number of places where a Bahá’í pa�ern of
community life has a�ained such prevalence is modest,
yet it is growing. Here is witnessed a release of the
society-building power of the Faith unlike anything
that has been seen before.

6.15

Naturally, prevalence of Bahá’í activity on this
scale is not a prospect everywhere. It is necessary to
appreciate the difference that is made by the conditions
in a cluster or in parts of a cluster and by the characteristics of a people—that is, by the reality of circumstances.
Accordingly, the ways in which the society-building
power of the Faith will find expression in different
se�ings will vary. But regardless of the extent to which

52

Bahá’í community life embraces those who reside in a
particular area—regardless, even, of the intensity of a
programme of growth in a cluster or the level of activity in a neighbourhood or village—the challenge facing
the friends serving at the grassroots is essentially
the same in every place. They must be able to read their
own reality and ask: what, in light of the possibilities
and requirements at hand, would be fi�ing objectives to
pursue in the coming cycle or series of cycles? You and
your auxiliaries are ideally placed to put this question
and to ensure that appropriate strategies are identified.
Much can be learned from the experience of the friends
in similar clusters, for a community that is a step further
along the same path can provide valuable insights
about the goal to strive for next. As the friends ponder
what is before them, they will readily see that for every
community there is a goal in reach, and for every goal
a path to reach it. Looking ahead on this path, might
we not perceive Bahá’u’lláh Himself, the reins of
humanity’s affairs in one hand, His other beckoning all
to hasten, hasten?
Contributing to social transformation
The Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is concerned with the
transformation of both humanity’s inner life and
social environment. A le�er wri�en on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi describes how the social environment
provides the “atmosphere” in which souls can “grow
spiritually and reflect in full the light of God” shining
through the Revelation. A clear sign that the societybuilding power of the Cause is being released in a

53

6.16

cluster is that efforts are being made by a growing
band of its inhabitants, inspired by the teachings of
the Faith, to help improve the spiritual character and
social conditions of the wider community to which
they belong. The contribution made by Bahá’ís is distinguished by its focus on building capacity for service;
it is an approach founded on faith in the ability of
a population to become the protagonists of their
own development.

6.17

As the intensity of community-building work in a
cluster increases, the friends there inevitably become
more conscious of social, economic, or cultural barriers
that are impeding people’s spiritual and material
progress. Children and junior youth lacking support
in their education, pressures on girls resulting from
traditional customs related to early marriage, families
needing help with navigating unfamiliar systems of
healthcare, a village struggling for want of some basic
necessity, or long-standing prejudices arising from a
legacy of hostility between different groups—when a
Bahá’í community’s efforts in the field of expansion
and consolidation bring it into contact with these
situations and many others, it will be drawn to
respond to such realities as its circumstances permit.
In reflecting on such situations it becomes evident that,
within clusters, expansion and consolidation, social
action, and contributing to prevalent discourses are
dimensions of a single, unified, outward-looking
endeavour carried out at the grassroots of society. All
these efforts are pursued according to a common

54

framework for action, and this above all else brings
coherence to the overall pa�ern of activity.
The initial stirrings of grassroots social action
begin to be seen in a cluster as the availability of human
resources increases and capacity for a wider range of
tasks develops. Villages have proven to be notably
fertile ground from which social action initiatives have
emerged and been sustained, but in urban se�ings too,
friends living there have succeeded in carrying out
activities and projects suited to the social environment,
at times by working with local schools, agencies of civil
society, or even government bodies. Social action is
being undertaken in a number of important fields,
including the environment, agriculture, health, the
arts, and particularly education. Over the course of the
Nine Year Plan, and especially as the study of specific
institute courses stimulates greater activity in this area,
we expect to see a proliferation of formal and informal
efforts to promote the social and economic development
of a people. Some of these community-based initiatives
will require basic administrative structures to sustain
their work. Where conditions are propitious, Local
Spiritual Assemblies will need to be encouraged to
learn how best to cultivate new, fledgling initiatives
and to foster efforts that show promise. In some cases,
the needs associated with a particular field of endeavour
will warrant the establishment of a Bahá’í-inspired organization, and we anticipate the appearance of more
such organizations during the coming Plan. For their
part, National Spiritual Assemblies will have to find
ways in which they can stay well informed about what

55

6.18

is being learned at the grassroots of their communities
and analyse the experience being gained; in some
places this will call for the creation of an entity dedicated
to following social action. Looking across the Bahá’í
world, we are delighted to see how much momentum
has already been generated in this area of endeavour
through the encouragement and support of the Bahá’í
International Development Organization.

6.19

Closely connected with the capacity for engaging
in social action is a capacity for contributing to the
discourses of society. At heart, this is simply a capacity
for participating in a conversation about a ma�er
that affects people’s lives and offering a perspective
grounded in Bahá’í principles and Bahá’í experience.
Viewed in this way, it is a skill which many Bahá’ís
have the opportunity to practise almost daily, for instance
in their studies or occupations, and which is cultivated
through involvement in institute courses; in its more
formal expression, it is central to the work of the Bahá’í
International Community and national Offices of External
Affairs. However, in relation to the release of the societybuilding power of the Faith at the grassroots, it is a
capacity that comes into greater demand as closer
association with a population, brought about through
the work of expansion and consolidation, leads to
increased consciousness of an area’s prevailing social
problems, as well as of the aspirations of its people to
overcome them. As the number of those participating
in community-building activities rises, so does the
need for the Bahá’í community to offer, as a unified
body, its considered perspective on obstacles to social

56

progress and on issues that weigh on the minds and
spirits of those with whom it interacts. This has
particular implications for Local Spiritual Assemblies.
In places where the activities of the Plan have a�ained
a degree of prevalence, the Assembly begins to be
viewed more widely as a source of moral insight. Over
time, efforts to contribute to societal discourses become
more systematic, and Bahá’ís become adept at helping
those around them to engage constructively in a
discourse and find consensus. Opportunities are sought
out to share the perspectives of the Faith with community
leaders and figures in authority, and spaces are
created in which representatives of various groups
and interests can be assisted to reach a common point
of view through consultation. We are pleased with
the steps that have already been taken to learn how
insights from the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh and from
the experience of Bahá’í communities can be brought
to bear upon pressing social issues at the local level;
much more is sure to be learned in this regard during
the Nine Year Plan.
We wish to stress that, historically and now,
social action and efforts to participate in the prevalent
discourses of society have emerged not only in the
context of growth, but also as a result of individual
Bahá’ís striving to contribute to society’s progress in
ways available to them. As a personal response to
Bahá’u’lláh’s summons to work for the be�erment of
the world, believers have variously chosen to adopt
certain vocations and have sought out opportunities
to support the activities of like-minded groups and

57

6.20

organizations. Projects, both large and small, have
been started in order to respond to a range of social
issues. Numerous Bahá’í-inspired organizations have
been established by groups of individuals to work
for many different objectives, and specialist entities
have been founded to give a�ention to a particular
discourse. All of these efforts, at whatever scale they
have been undertaken, have benefited from being able
to draw on the principles and insights guiding the
activities occurring at the grassroots of the worldwide
Bahá’í community, and they have also benefited from
the wise counsels of Local and National Spiritual
Assemblies. We rejoice to see these diverse, harmonious
expressions of faith by the devoted followers of the
Blessed Beauty, in response to the tribulations of a
perplexed and sorely agitated world.
Educational endeavours and the training institute

6.21

The importance of education to a Bahá’í conception
of spiritual and social transformation can hardly be
overestimated. “Consider”, Bahá’u’lláh states, “the
revelation of the light of the Name of God, the
Educator. Behold, how in all things the evidences of
such a revelation are manifest, how the be�erment of
all beings dependeth upon it.” The significance of
education in the work of community building is
unmistakable, and in the field of social action the
provision of education remains the signature contribution of Bahá’ís in most parts of the world. Pre-eminent
among the structures and agencies created by the
Bahá’í world to offer education is, of course, the

58

training institute. Indeed, the network of national
and regional training institutes operating with such
proficiency around the globe is among the choicest
fruits of the previous series of global Plans. Building
capacity for service within communities by enabling
ever-increasing numbers of individuals to benefit
from the institute process will continue to be a central
feature of the Plans in the present series. The
capacity for community development that has already
emerged, represented by hundreds of thousands
of individuals who are able to serve as tutors,
animators, or children’s class teachers, is a resource
of historic consequence.
When we first introduced the concept of the training
institute, it was in the context of the need to raise up
human resources to take on the tasks of expansion and
consolidation. At this juncture, when a new series of
Plans has just begun, we invite you to take a more
expansive view. Increasingly, participation in institute
courses is preparing the friends of God for an
ever-deeper engagement in the life of the wider
community; it is endowing them with the knowledge,
insights, and skills that enable them to contribute
not only to the process of developing their own
community, but to the progress of society. In short,
the institute is a potent means for the society-building
power of the Faith to find release. Although the task
of developing curricular materials to support this
purpose is a long-term undertaking, existing materials
already aim to build capacity for a broad range of
initiatives. Moreover, they offer a seamless coherent

59

6.22

educational experience from the age of five, upwards
to the age of junior youth, and through into adulthood,
and they serve as a direct counterpart to the pa�ern of
activities unfolding at the grassroots. In relation to
this, we have been pleased to see the rich insights that
the friends in different parts of the world, in a variety
of social and cultural contexts, are generating about
aspects of community development. If these insights,
and those still to emerge, are to benefit Bahá’í
communities more widely, systems for the preparation
and refinement of educational materials will need to
be extended. With this in mind, we will soon set
out the approach that will guide this work over the
coming years.

6.23

With respect to raising the capacity of institutes to
deliver each of the three stages of the educational
process, we are glad to see that a�ention is increasingly
being given to enhancing the quality of the educational
experience itself, in addition to expanding the system
for its delivery. A critical requirement is to enable all
those contributing to the work of the institute to
progressively advance their understanding of the
educational content: its objectives, its structure, its
pedagogical principles, its methodology, its central
concepts, its interconnections. Many training institute
boards have been supported in this regard by the
collaborative groups described in our message to your
2015 conference. In places, separate teams have also
begun to focus respectively on children’s classes, junior
youth groups, and study circles, identifying factors
that contribute to their effectiveness and finding ways

60

to assist the friends involved in each avenue of service
to further raise their own capacity. The Auxiliary
Board members in a region and their assistants are
often the first to see to it that what is being learned
reaches a wider number of friends across adjoining
clusters and within centres of intense activity. Individuals
with a depth of experience in the promotion of institute
activities are serving as resource persons, and they
have proved instrumental in helping institutes at an
earlier point of development to advance. Nevertheless,
in general it is Counsellors who are ensuring that each
institute becomes familiar with the many essential insights
being generated by their sister agencies in neighbouring
countries and regions. Counsellors have arranged for
institutes to be organized into groupings of varying
sizes to enable the lessons that are being learned by the
most experienced institutes to be shared more widely,
increasingly through the means of formal seminars.
All these arrangements will need to be strengthened
during the next Plan. In places where a site for the
dissemination of learning about the junior youth
spiritual empowerment programme is operating,
collaboration between the learning site and associated
institutes has already proved extremely fruitful, and it
should intensify; their pursuit of a common goal and
their shared desire to see clusters advance create ideal
conditions for the spirit of cooperation and mutual
assistance to flourish. The knowledge that has now
accumulated about factors that contribute to the
effectiveness of the institute process is extensive, and
we look to the International Teaching Centre to

61

organize what has been learned and make it available
to you.

6.24

What we have described above is an educational
system in a state of constant refinement. This requires
many individuals to lend their support to its further
development; it also requires institutes, and Bahá’í
institutions more generally, to plan ahead and ensure
that individuals who have developed considerable
capacity in supporting the community’s educational
endeavours are able to sustain their service and can,
when their life circumstances change, continue to
be involved in the work of the institute in other
meaningful ways. Appreciating the effectiveness of
the institute process, every follower of Bahá’u’lláh will
feel a desire to contribute to its advancement in some
way—not least, the Bahá’í youth. Institutes know well
that releasing the potential possessed by young people
is, for them, a sacred charge; we now ask that Bahá’í
youth view the future development of the institute in
the very same light. At the vanguard of a nine-year,
community-wide endeavour to bring the institute to
a higher level of functioning, we expect to see a
broad movement of youth setting the standard.
They should seize every opportunity—in their schools
and universities, and in spaces dedicated to work,
family, or social interaction—to encourage more and
more souls to benefit from the institute’s programmes.
Some youth will be able to devote a period of service—
perhaps even successive years—to the provision of
education, especially to those younger than themselves;
for many, support for the institute’s activities will be

62

an ever-present dimension of their lives throughout
their own education and as they seek a livelihood from
their calling in this world; but for none should it be
anything less than a cherished commitment.
In many parts of the world, a natural outcome of
the participation of individuals and families in the
institute process has been an increased consciousness
of the importance of education in all its forms. Friends
serving as children’s class teachers take a keen interest
in the broad educational development of those they
teach, while friends serving as tutors and animators
are naturally concerned with the extent to which those
approaching or entering adulthood—girls and boys
alike—can access and benefit from education of many
kinds, not limited to the courses offered by the institute
itself. For instance, they can encourage young people
to look towards apprenticeships or university studies.
We have been struck by how, in many communities,
engagement in the institute process by large numbers
has gradually reshaped this aspect of culture within a
population. The institutions of the Faith will need to
take responsibility for ensuring that, as consciousness
is raised in this way, the noble aspirations that arise in
young people as a result—aspirations to acquire the
education and training that will allow them to offer a
lifetime of meaningful service to their society—can be
fulfilled. The long-term development of a community
and, ultimately, of a nation, from generation to
generation, depends to a large degree on the effort
made to invest in those who will assume responsibility
for collective social progress.

63

6.25

6.26

This exploration of the centrality of education to a
community founded on Bahá’í principles would be
incomplete without a further observation. Shoghi
Effendi has laid great stress on the importance of
striving, through “constant endeavour”, to obtain “a
more adequate understanding of the significance of
Bahá’u’lláh’s stupendous Revelation”. The training
institute has no parallel as an instrument for the
systematic exposure of limitless numbers of souls to
the life-giving waters of the Revelation and the
inexhaustible meaning of the Word of God. But the
friends’ efforts to increase their understanding of the
Faith and its teachings are of course not limited to
participation in the institute process. Indeed, one
strong indicator of an institute’s effectiveness is the
thirst it cultivates within those who engage with its
materials to continue to study the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh—individually, but also collectively,
whether in formal spaces created by the institutions or
in more informal se�ings. Beyond the study of the
Revelation itself, the implications that the teachings
hold for countless fields of human endeavour are of
great importance. A notable example of one form of
education through which young believers are becoming
be�er acquainted with a Bahá’í perspective on issues
relevant to the progress of humanity is participation in
the seminars offered by the Institute for Studies in
Global Prosperity. Given the vastness of the ocean of
the Revelation, it will be apparent that exploring its
depths is a lifelong occupation of every soul who
would tread the path of service.

64

As the contribution being made by the Faith to the
progress of society in different parts of the world
gains greater visibility, the Bahá’í community will
increasingly be called upon to explicate the principles
it advocates, and to demonstrate their applicability to
the issues facing humanity. The more the intellectual
life of a community blossoms and thrives, the greater
its capacity to answer this call. It will be up to the
followers of Bahá’u’lláh to provide, in the world of
ideas, the intellectual rigour and clarity of thought to
match their commitment to spiritual and material
progress in the world of deeds.

6.27

Raising capacity for administration at all levels
Eighty years ago, a le�er wri�en on behalf of the
Guardian described Bahá’í administration as “the first
shaping of what in future will come to be the social life
and laws of community living”. Today, at the beginning
of the second century of the Formative Age, the shape
of Bahá’í administration has developed considerably,
and its continued development will be essential for the
release of the society-building power of the Faith.

6.28

The administration of the Faith at the grassroots is,
of course, intimately connected with the development
of Local Spiritual Assemblies. These nascent Houses
of Justice are described by Shoghi Effendi as “the
chief sinews of Bahá’í society, as well as the ultimate
foundation of its administrative structure”, and he
greatly emphasizes the importance of their formation.
In 1995, we called for the reinstitution of the practice

6.29

65

that required all Local Assemblies, including those
being newly formed, to be elected on the First Day of
Riḍván rather than at any other time of year. This
development was related to the fact that, while
believers from outside a locality could assist with the
electoral process, the primary responsibility for electing
any Assembly and maintaining its operations rests
with the Bahá’ís of that place; much depends on their
readiness for undertaking administrative activity. It
has been seen, in recent years, how a sense of Bahá’í
identity can gradually gain strength in an area as a
pa�ern of action grounded in the teachings becomes
established among individuals and families living
there. Thus, a community will often have a�ained a
certain level of capacity in relation to communitybuilding endeavours by the time the formation
of a Local Assembly becomes possible. As this point
approaches—and it should not be unduly delayed—
efforts have to be made to cultivate an appreciation for
the formal aspects of community life associated with
Bahá’í administration. The Local Assembly that emerges
in such a milieu is likely to be well aware of its
responsibility to encourage and strengthen those
activities which help to sustain a vibrant community.
However, it will also need to gain proficiency in
discharging a wide range of other responsibilities, and
the support provided to it by your auxiliaries and their
assistants will be vitally important. In our message to
your 2010 conference, we described the developmental
path of such an Assembly, and we referred to various
dimensions of its functioning that would need
to receive attention, including its ability to man-

66

age and develop a Local Fund and, in time, to
support initiatives of social action and to interact with
agencies of local government and civil society. The
benefits that accrue to a community being served by
such an Assembly need no elaboration.
In your interactions with National Spiritual
Assemblies and Regional Bahá’í Councils, we ask that
you devote a�ention to the ma�er of establishing Local
Spiritual Assemblies and consolidating their operations,
especially in areas where this aspect of growth may
have received less emphasis. We anticipate this will
contribute to a rapid rise in the number of Local
Assemblies formed year on year. In some countries,
your consultations will need to include consideration
of whether in rural areas existing arrangements for
defining the boundaries of each locality are adequate.

6.30

One compelling insight which has emerged is that
the extent to which the station and leadership of
a Local Assembly is recognized in a community is
related to how deeply the believers appreciate the
sacredness of the electoral process and their duty to
participate in it, in an atmosphere wholly free from the
taint of suasion or worldly a�itudes about power. As
consciousness is raised in a community about the
spiritual principles underlying Bahá’í elections, a new
conception is formed of what it means for someone to
be called to serve on an institution, and understanding
grows of how the individual, the community, and the
Local Assembly and its agencies relate to one another.
Where systematic effort has been made to stimulate

6.31

67

conversations in a community about the formation of
the Local Assembly and its purpose, and to sustain
those conversations year after year, the strength of the
elected body and the dynamism of community life
reinforce each other.

6.32

This reciprocal effect has been especially noticeable
over the last two years in places where we have
approved the adoption of a two-stage electoral process
for a Local Spiritual Assembly, an approach which
traces its origins to instructions given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
to the Spiritual Assembly of Ṭihrán. Twenty-two Local
Assemblies, spread over eight countries, have already
begun to be elected by this method during this period.
Similar in many respects to the election of a National
Spiritual Assembly, it involves the division of a locality
into units from each of which one or more delegates
are elected, after which the delegates elect the members
of the Local Assembly. As the number of Bahá’ís residing
in a locality grows large and the community’s capacity
for managing complexity increases, the case for
implementing a two-stage electoral process becomes
commensurately stronger. Accordingly, in the coming
Plan, we expect to authorize the adoption of this
method for electing a Local Assembly in many more
places, both urban and rural, where conditions make
such a step timely.

6.33

A Local Spiritual Assembly maintains a keen
interest in learning how best to advance the
community-building work within its jurisdiction, and
as such it consults regularly with friends involved in

68

coordinating endeavours in the cluster. It follows
closely the development of any centres of intense
activity in the locality, especially by offering support
to the teams of believers who have emerged there
and are stimulating the process of growth. In general,
the more the intensification of activity requires
organizational arrangements at the level of the locality
or in parts of the locality—say, arranging campaigns of
home visits, accompanying families who are holding
devotional meetings, or encouraging them to form
groups to work together—the more prominent the role
that can be assumed by the Local Assembly in this
regard. In localities where large numbers are being
welcomed into the embrace of Bahá’í activities, and
where the complexity of an Assembly’s work and
manifold responsibilities is increasing, the Assembly
sometimes finds that its Secretary needs to be
supported by a staffed office, and eventually, the
need for a befi�ing local Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds becomes
more pressing.
As Local Assemblies begin to take on a greater
and greater share of responsibility for nurturing the
development of the community, institutions at the
regional and national levels must become more systematic
in their efforts to support them. We have been pleased
to see this need being addressed in methodical ways,
for instance by National Assemblies or Regional
Councils convening periodic meetings with the
Secretaries and other officers of Local Assemblies to
consult about the unfoldment of specific lines of action.

69

6.34

6.35

Where a Regional Council has developed an
enhanced capacity for administration, including an
ability to provide appropriate kinds of support to
many clusters at once, this has been conducive to the
accelerated progress of the whole region. Our message
to your 2015 conference indicated that in smaller countries where the establishment of Regional Councils is
not required, a formal structure would need to emerge
at the national level which would be charged with
helping clusters to advance. We ask that, in countries
where this has not yet occurred, you now consult with
National Assemblies about the steps that can be taken
to appoint that formal structure, namely, a National
Growth Commi�ee with three, five, or seven members.
The National Assembly will need to give this agency
the necessary latitude to foster the movement of
clusters, drawing relevant insights from what has been
learned about Regional Councils in this regard. Its
responsibilities can include appointing Area Teaching
Committees and encouraging them in their plans,
arranging for the deployment of homefront pioneers,
supporting teaching projects, and distributing core literature. The Commi�ee will benefit from being able to
collaborate closely with the training institute, itself
an agency of the National Assembly, and with the
Auxiliary Board members serving the country, and it
will also be able to communicate directly with the
relevant Counsellor. While a National Assembly will
naturally wish to maintain an ongoing familiarity with
the work of the Commi�ee and provide it with guidance,
support, and encouragement, creating an entity that is
wholly occupied with promoting growth should enable

70

an Assembly to give greater attention to other
important ma�ers. In countries where Councils have
not been formed but could be established eventually, a
National Growth Commi�ee should also be appointed
at this time.
As the spiritual energies released by earnest pursuit
of the Plan surge, they meet resistance from the
countervailing forces that hold humanity back from
a�aining full maturity. In the face of such forces, the
vitality of the various lines of action being followed at
the local level needs to be preserved and fortified. This
critical responsibility is of special relevance to the
members of the two Auxiliary Boards, whose numerous,
demanding duties keep them closely connected to
conditions at the grassroots and alert to anything that
might affect the spirit of a community. Across different
cultures and social environments, they must assist the
friends to face different kinds of challenges: to help
previously antagonistic groups find unity through
pursuit of a common goal; to learn to put aside inherited
customs and a�itudes that belong to humanity’s
period of adolescence, and to overcome prejudices of
all kinds; to guard against any tendency to view
ma�ers with cynicism or an eye for faults, and instead
sustain an eager and constructive outlook; to put the
equality of women and men into practice; to cast off
inertia and apathy through the exercise of individual
initiative; to put one’s support of plans for collective
action before feelings of personal preference; to
harness the power of modern technologies without
succumbing to their potentially enervating effects; to

71

6.36

prize the sweetness of teaching the Faith and the joy of
serving humankind above worldly interests; to reject the
opiate of consumerism; to turn away from materialist
ideologies and the worldviews they aggressively
promote, and fix one’s gaze upon the bright beacon
that is the laws and principles of God. These, and
many more besides, constitute a formidable set of
responsibilities for the company of the faithful to fulfil
as they navigate what are sure to be tumultuous years
in the life of humanity. Your auxiliaries, who have so
creditably acqui�ed themselves in advancing the
process of entry by troops, must be equal to all such
challenges whenever and wherever they arise.
Through the power of their good example and the clarity
of their good counsel, may they help the friends to
grow in faith, assurance, and commitment to a life
of service, and accompany them as they build
communities that are havens of peace, places where a
harried and conflict-scarred humanity may find shelter.

6.37

Over the last series of Plans, the community’s
capacity to maintain focus on the Faith’s most pressing
needs emerged as one of its most important strengths.
However, this sense of focus has to accommodate many
lines of action, all of which must advance without
being in competition. This calls for an expanded vision,
a nuanced understanding of coexisting imperatives, added
flexibility, and heightened institutional collaboration.
We are conscious that the Faith’s resources are finite,
and individuals experience many demands on their
time. But as the Plan unfolds in a given place and the
ranks of those who are willing to serve swell, the varied

72

aspects of a rich and vibrant Bahá’í community life will
advance in step, and the society-building power of the
Faith shine forth.
A historic mission
We hope to have impressed upon you, in these
pages, that the present-day capacity of the Bahá’í
community, combined with the discipline it has
achieved through adherence to a coherent framework
for action, has prepared it for an extensive, rigorous
test of all its resources, spiritual as well as material.
The Plan that will shortly commence—the first major
undertaking in a sacred twenty-five-year venture,
generational in its scope and significance—will make
demands of the individual believer, the community,
and the institutions reminiscent of the demands that
the Guardian made of the Bahá’í world at the outset of
the Ten Year Crusade. If, by the grace of Almighty
God, the friends should succeed in reaching the
heights of heroism to which they are now summoned,
history will assuredly pay tribute to their actions in
terms no less glowing than those with which it honours
the glorious deeds that decorate the annals of the first
century of the Formative Age.

6.38

We put great reliance on you and on National
Spiritual Assemblies to ensure that, in all the efforts
made to acquaint the friends with the nature of this
collective enterprise, the perspective of history is kept
fully in view. The civilization of today, for all its material
prowess, has been found wanting, and the verdict has

6.39

73

been issued by the Supreme Pen: “Know ye not that
We have rolled up that which the people possessed,
and have unfolded a new order in its place?” The
establishment of Divine Civilization is, in the words
of the Guardian, “the primary mission of the Bahá’í
Faith”. It is to be built upon the most foundational
qualities, ones for which the world stands in
great need: unity, trustworthiness, mutual support,
collaboration, fellow feeling, selflessness, commitment
to truth, a sense of responsibility, a thirst to learn, the
love of an all-embracing heart.

6.40

How we long to see humanity illumined with the
love of its Lord; how we long to hear His praise on
every tongue. Knowing the ardency of our wish, you
know then the emotion with which, when we lay our
heads upon the Most Holy Threshold, we implore
Bahá’u’lláh to make you, and all who cherish His
precious Faith, ever more perfect channels of His
ineffable grace.

To all National Spiritual Assemblies
Dearly loved Friends,
Over the twenty-five-year period that ended at
Riḍván 2021, the endeavours of training institutes to
help the friends enhance their capacity for service were
central to progress. When, at the beginning of the last
series of global Plans, we called for systematic a�ention
to be given to devising methods for training large numbers
of believers, institutes faced the task of developing
their own materials or selecting from those readily
available. Generally, institutes found it challenging to
develop new materials; however, those that adopted
the courses prepared by the Ruhi Institute were able to
make rapid progress. Therefore, as was stated in our
message to you of 28 December 2005, we determined
that the books of the Ruhi Institute, which had proven
their efficacy, would constitute the main sequence
of courses of institutes everywhere at least for the
remainder of that series of Plans. The extensive use of
these courses, as well as of the lessons and texts for
the spiritual education of children and junior youth,
expedited the advance of the institute process across
the globe. Now, with the Bahá’í world embarked on a
new series of global Plans, we have considered again
the question of the materials of training institutes and
wish to convey our conclusions.

75

7.1

7.2

The knowledge and insights, the spiritual qualities
and a�itudes, and the skills and abilities for service
treated in the courses of the Ruhi Institute remain vital
to the efforts of Bahá’í communities. Therefore, these
materials will continue to be a prominent feature of the
educational endeavours of all training institutes during this new series of global Plans. We are aware that
the Ruhi Institute will, during the Nine Year Plan, seek
to complete the preparation of all the materials it has
outlined for use in children’s classes, junior youth
groups, and study circles, and the revision of published editions as necessary in light of experience.
However, beyond what it has already delineated, it is
not expected to develop new materials to be used
worldwide.

7.3

In our message dated 30 December 2021 to the
Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors,
we highlighted how pleased we have been to observe
the rich body of knowledge and insights which the
friends, labouring in diverse social and cultural
contexts, are generating about aspects of the community-building process. The friends are also becoming
increasingly adept at identifying needs related to growth
that are emerging naturally from efforts at the grassroots.
These developments have implications for the systems
for preparing and refining educational materials. We
have thus concluded that it would now be propitious
for more a�ention to be paid to extending the capacity
to prepare educational materials, particularly in
relation to supplementary materials and branch courses.

76

When we addressed the question of materials for
the education of children and junior youth in our
message to you of 12 December 2011, we indicated
that, beyond the materials that are the core of each of
these programmes, teachers and animators would,
often in consultation with the institute coordinator at
the cluster level, determine whether or not additional
elements would be required to reinforce the educational process. The impressive advances in many parts
of the world with regard to offering spiritual education
to large numbers of children and junior youth have
certainly involved a growing capacity of teachers and
animators to wisely supplement the study of the lessons
and texts with appropriate elements on the basis of
their specific circumstances. Notable in this respect are
elements related to artistic activity and service projects.
Nonetheless, when the need to supplement the study
of a particular topic has been felt across a country or
region, some institutes have themselves developed or
adopted additional materials and have arranged for
them to be disseminated more extensively. These
supplementary items have, for the most part, been simple
elements, such as songs or stories. A similar experience
is unfolding in relation to the main sequence of
courses, although the additional materials that some
institutes have introduced in this connection, which
include compilations from the Bahá’í writings on
specific topics and case studies of relevant experience,
tend to be of a more complex nature.

7.4

The flourishing of a vibrant process of spiritual
education in growing numbers of clusters will require

7.5

77

of institutes a well-developed ability to oversee the
appropriate introduction of supplementary elements.
In this, institutes must be as much concerned with
reinforcing the educational process as with
maintaining its integrity. They will thus need to
bear in mind the various cautions we set out in
our 12 December 2011 message. They must, of course,
also guard against overwhelming the friends
with diverse additional elements that, by their sheer
volume, might inadvertently detract from the effective
delivery of the principal materials.

7.6

Concerning branch courses, how they are to
emerge must be understood in the context of the
dynamics in countries and regions where the community-building process is advancing with intensity.
As many more friends dedicate themselves to
promoting the various activities to which the study of
institute courses gives rise, distinct areas of learning
associated with each of these activities steadily take
shape in the life of a population. Some of these areas
of learning, such as those concerned with collective
worship, deepening, and teaching, are supported by
Area Teaching Commi�ees, while others related to the
spiritual education of children, junior youth, and
youth and adults are fostered by the training institutes.
Additional areas of learning supported by other
agencies also gradually come into place as more and
more people study the higher courses of the institute’s
sequence. As the endeavours in each of these areas
are sustained by growing numbers of friends, fresh
insights are generated that are distinctive in that

78

they arise from systematic effort undertaken in a
particular social and cultural setting. There is an
increasing understanding of what other concepts,
approaches, abilities, and a�itudes are essential to
advancing an aspect of the community-building
process. These become objects of conversation in
periodic gatherings held to consult and reflect on the
experience being gained. Aside from the initiatives
individuals or institutions and agencies may take to
respond to these needs, the institute might decide to
promote the use of a supplementary material as
described above. Over time, what is learned is captured
by the institutions and agencies of the Faith in various
documents, narrative accounts, and case studies which,
in their totality, constitute a record of unfolding
experience. When a sizeable body of knowledge accumulates, it becomes possible to further systematize it
by developing a branch course.
We have in the past likened the main sequence to the
trunk of a tree that supports other courses branching
from it, each branch addressing some specific area of
action. The preparation of such branch courses would
necessarily occur over time through a pa�ern marked by
action and reflection and in which conceptualization
and activity in the field go hand in hand. For training
institutes that take on this task, there are several
requisites. They will need to be able to understand
profoundly the content of the institute’s main sequence
and the pedagogical principles involved, analyse
clearly the experience arising at the grassroots as
activities advance, collaborate with teams of friends

79

7.7

dedicated to the progress of specific aspects of the
community-building process, operate in a learning mode,
and draw into their work individuals with abilities
needed for preparing materials. Once in place, the
branch course would help the friends promoting the
related activity to further strengthen their capacity,
and it would contribute to extending the associated
process of learning in the life of the population. The
course would also serve as a repository of the accruing
knowledge and as a means for its propagation.

7.8

Developing materials of this nature is a complex
exercise, and it is of course not a goal that every training institute develop its own branch courses. Training
institutes, in consultation with the National Spiritual
Assembly and the Counsellors, will determine when
it is timely to develop or adopt such additional
educational materials. Many institutes will simply
select branch courses appropriate to their needs from
those of proven effectiveness created by other institutes.
Beyond branch courses, it is anticipated that institutes
will in the future prepare or adopt other types of
courses, which may be integrated in some way into the
main sequence or be offered separately. This will,
naturally, require the acquisition of even greater capacity
by the institutes. However, notwithstanding the farreaching effects of their efforts, institutes are not
expected to address all the educational needs of the
Bahá’í community. Within divers populations, large-scale
growth will lead to new educational endeavours to
address other pressing demands.

80

We are confident that, as the friends labour in all
regions to release the society-building power of the
Faith, the years ahead will witness a significant further
expansion of the capacity of training institutes to provide
spiritual education to large numbers and to generate,
apply, and disseminate knowledge. As part of its mandate
to watch over the process of human resource development, we have asked the International Teaching Centre
to follow closely the raising of capacity for preparing
educational materials. It will establish mechanisms
for supporting the institutes and for ensuring that
what is learned is appropriately propagated.

7.9

We will beseech the Blessed Beauty in the Holy
Shrines that the operations of training institutes,
these vital agencies of the Faith, may ever receive
His unfailing blessings and confirmations.

To the Auxiliary Board members
throughout the world
Dearly loved Friends,
On this day that we had awaited with so much
anticipation to welcome you all in the Holy Land for a
joint conference with the members of the Continental
Boards of Counsellors, we feel moved to write to
you and express our sadness that, owing to world
conditions, this longed-for gathering could not
take place. The sentiments that we had hoped to
express to you in person must now be conveyed from
afar. But distance does not diminish the intensity of
the love we have for each one of you.

8.1

It is one hundred years to the day since the
first public reading of the Will and Testament of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In that precious Document, He set out
the obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God, for
whose support the Auxiliary Boards for Propagation
and Protection were originally created. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
summoned the Hands of the Cause “to diffuse the
Divine Fragrances, to edify the souls of men, to
promote learning, to improve the character of all men
and to be, at all times and under all conditions,
sanctified and detached from earthly things.” Reading
these words at this time evokes for us the service that

8.2

83

each of you are carrying out across the Bahá’í world.
Indeed, the worldwide Bahá’í community owes
a debt of gratitude to the entire institution of the
Counsellors, including all those who have served as
Continental Counsellors, Auxiliary Board members,
and assistants in years gone by. Without such
devoted service from so many, the marvellous
advances made in recent decades, which are evident
in the world today, could not have occurred. And an
indispensable contribution to that progress has
been the guidance and encouragement provided by
the International Teaching Centre: an institution
agile and perspicacious, and wholly indefatigable.

8.3

By now you have had the opportunity to become
acquainted with the provisions of the Nine Year Plan
and to ponder its implications. As will be apparent,
the range of fields in which the believers are being
asked to serve within their clusters, in order to
release the society-building power of the Faith in
ever-greater measures, has broadened. Correspondingly,
the range of ma�ers to which you must give serious
a�ention has broadened as well. Your efforts are integral
to the work of developing capacity to contribute to
the Bahá’í community’s various areas of endeavour,
and your efforts are just as integral to helping the
friends demonstrate in action the capacity they have
acquired. In a�ending to both of these needs, and
more generally in fulfilling your responsibilities
for education and the improvement of character, you
of course rely a great deal on the efficacy of the
institute process. Ever since its creation, the institute

84

has been an essential instrument for your work,
and equally, your energetic support has been
essential to its development. It brings us much
joy, then, to see the pronounced, earnest spirit of
collaboration that characterizes your relationship
with all those responsible for coordinating the
institute’s endeavours.
You have no doubt read the description we
presented, in our message to the Counsellors a few
days ago, of how you must help the friends to find
a fitting response to each of the many challenges they
encounter in their pursuit of the Plan. In this regard,
we feel sure you are conscious that, however beneficial
the influence of your counsel, the influence of your
example will be greater still. A notable strength of
your office is that it connects the believers with the
different levels of Bahá’í administration and reinforces
the spirit of cooperation that binds them together. You
have a vital duty to help raise consciousness of the
purpose of Bahá’í administration and to assist with the
establishment and proper functioning of new Local
Spiritual Assemblies. You keep the friends connected
with the plans and projects of Bahá’í institutions
operating at the local, regional, and national levels.
Ultimately, you strengthen the connection between
the friends and the Universal House of Justice by
encouraging and leading the study of messages as
they emerge. The believers look to you for a sound
understanding of the Plan and for a courageous
example of how to put its provisions into effect,
especially in teaching the Faith. Your strong familiarity

85

8.4

with the reality of circumstances in various clusters,
combined with your thorough grasp of what is
required for the Cause to advance, puts you in an
ideal position to make thoughtful, creative, and
timely contributions to consultations about how to
release the society-building power of the Faith in
every se�ing.

8.5

In addition to the foregoing, we wish to draw
a�ention to your special role in encouraging the youth.
So many youth who are now winning victories for the
Cause were inspired by an Auxiliary Board member
or assistant whose enthusiastic support and spirit of
devotion taught them to rely on the power of divine
confirmations and boldly enter the arena of service.
Your responsibilities extend even further to the
promotion of the education of children and junior
youth, to the upliftment of the young, and to the
strengthening of a pattern of family life that will
produce generation after generation of consecrated
souls, faithful followers of Bahá’u’lláh who have chosen
the be�erment of the world over the advancement of
personal interests. The youth who, in the final year of
the Nine Year Plan, will be carrying out acts of service
to ensure its ultimate success are in many cases the
children who, today, need to be nurtured in their love
of the Blessed Beauty and their understanding of His
mission.

8.6

Beloved friends, in your moments of prayer, be assured
that all your entreaties to Bahá’u’lláh are accompanied
by our own supplications in the Holy Shrines on your

86

behalf. May your movement and your stillness be guided
by the gentle winds of His Will, and may He bestow
upon you the enduring bounty of being enabled to
serve Him in accordance with His wish.

4 January 2022

To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
We are at this moment with the company of the
Continental Counsellors—the great majority of them
present in the Holy Land, while some who could not
travel here join from a distance—and the sixth and
final day of their conference, focused on the upcoming
Nine Year Plan, is about to conclude. There is so much
that could be shared with you about the spirit of this
conference, as seen in its participants. Steeped in
experience, they have been eyewitnesses to the rise in
capacity in the Bahá’í world, and they brim with
confidence about what you can further accomplish.
We could not have wished for a keener, more insightful grasp of what is called for in the next Plan than was
demonstrated in the consultations of these consecrated
souls. But this, of course, is just the beginning. When
the Counsellors return to the countries of five
continents, they will bring to you and those who serve
with you all that they have absorbed. They and their
auxiliaries will be at your side as you prepare for this
immense collective enterprise—especially through
your participation in the wave of conferences soon to
sweep across the globe, where Bahá’u’lláh’s universal
summons to work for the be�erment of the world will
galvanize the assembled well-wishers of humanity.

89

9.1

9.2

A confluence of circumstances in the world at large
and within the Faith has made this a charged moment.
The global challenges now facing humanity are a
severe test of its willingness to put aside short-term
self-interest and come to terms with this stark spiritual
and moral reality: there is but one, interconnected
human family and it shares one precious homeland. At
this same moment, the followers of Bahá’u’lláh are
examining anew the possibilities before them to release
the society-building power of the Faith. This Plan will
test their stamina, their willpower, and the strength of
their love for those who dwell alongside them. They
will help to nurture, in every place, communities of
common purpose that recognize the power of unity to
heal, to transcend. Within these communities, every
soul may find sanctuary, and in the friends’ many endeavours for worship and praise, for education,
for social transformation, for the development of
communities—in all these, every soul may find room
to grow and to serve. We are stirred by the promise of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “The small shall be made great, and the
powerless shall be given strength; they that are of
tender age shall become the children of the Kingdom,
and those that have gone astray shall be guided to their
heavenly home.”

9.3

When Bahá’u’lláh sent forth His glad tidings, the
devoted believers who could carry His message to
humanity were so few in number. Today, praise be to
God, the devotion of the friends is undimmed and
their numbers have soared. May their hearts be
fortified through the power of His Word and, on every

90

occasion and in every space, may they shine with the
light of the splendours of heaven. Such will be the
prayer on our tongues and the hope in our breasts
when, today, with the Counsellors, we enter the Shrine
of the Blessed Beauty to supplicate on your behalf.
