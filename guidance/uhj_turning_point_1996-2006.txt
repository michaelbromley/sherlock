Preface

Preface

A

lmost ninety years ago, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá revealed the

Tablets of the Divine Plan, a plan “divine in origin,” the
“grand design for the spiritual conquest of the planet,”
which holds within it “the seeds of the world’s spiritual revival
and ultimate redemption.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá presented in “graphic”
language and “definite terms” guidance that originated with the
Báb and was reinforced by Bahá’u’lláh for the expansion and consolidation of the Faith throughout the world, ultimately leading
to the establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth. The Divine
Plan unfolds through a series of stages—first under the direction
of Shoghi Effendi and then the Universal House of Justice—that
will stretch “as far as the fringes” of the Golden Age.
To initiate the systematic implementation of the Divine
Plan, Shoghi Effendi directed Bahá’í communities to formulate
national plans of action, beginning with the first Seven Year
Plan in North America in 1937. Country after country gradually
reached the point where each could adopt its own plan. This led
to the international collaboration of six nations in the African
Campaign of 1951–1953 and, eventually, to the first global
plan, the Ten Year Crusade, which began in 1953 and involved
the combined efforts of the existing twelve National Spiritual
Assemblies. As a result of these plans, the Faith spread to villages, towns, cities, and provinces within countries and throughout the world, raising the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies
and strengthening the foundations of the Administrative Order.
The size and diversity of the membership of the community
greatly increased, particularly through the emergence in Uganda,
Indonesia, and other countries of the process of entry by
troops—where people began to enter the Faith not merely as a
steady flow of fresh recruits, but by hundreds, thousands, and
eventually, tens of thousands.
Shoghi Effendi foresaw “the launching of world-wide
enterprises destined to be embarked upon, in future epochs . . .
by the Universal House of Justice, that will symbolize the
unity and co-ordinate and unify the activities of these National
Assemblies.” After the end of the Ten Year Crusade, the
plans conducted under the direction of the House of Justice
maintained the objectives of spreading the Faith to new areas


Turning Point

and establishing local and national institutions, while gradually
adding new objectives to diversify and strengthen the capacities
of the Bahá’í world. The Nine Year Plan (1964–1973) included
the objectives of a vast expansion in membership and universal
participation by individuals in the life of the Cause. The Five
Year Plan (1974–1979) gave particular attention to developing
Local Assemblies and activities of Bahá’í community life, such as
regular observance of the Feast and Holy Days. The Seven Year
Plan (1979–1986) underscored the importance of involvement
in the affairs of society and introduced the pursuit of projects of
social and economic development. Bringing together seven major objectives for the progress of the Bahá’í world, the Six Year
Plan (1986–1992) instituted a procedure whereby national plans
were formulated in consultation between the Counsellors and
National Assemblies, while the Three Year Plan (1993–1996)
called for three developments that would contribute to the
seven objectives, that is, enhancing the vitality of the faith of the
individual believer, developing human resources, and fostering
the proper functioning of institutions.
Over this period of some three decades, the process of entry
by troops that began during the ministry of Shoghi Effendi
continued to gather momentum in other countries. Many had
tens of thousands of new believers; a few surpassed one hundred
thousand, while the Indian community grew by hundreds of
thousands to some two million. Such rapid growth, however, often carried out by a relatively small core of dedicated believers,
could not be matched by a pattern of consolidation that would
adequately deepen such vast numbers, educate their children,
raise institutions, and lay the foundations of community life.
Although large-scale expansion was initiated in country after
country, it could not be sustained. The challenge was not simply
to place emphasis on activities for consolidation, which, alone,
would lead to an inward-looking orientation and the potential
stagnation of the Bahá’í community. Rather, what was needed
was a capacity to maintain the balance between expansion and
consolidation in a pattern of systematic action over time.
This broad historical sketch provides the backdrop for the
decade from 1996 to 2006 that is the focus of the present book.
Beginning with the Four Year Plan (1996–2000), the Universal
House of Justice set the Bahá’í world on an unprecedented course
of action. “The next four years will represent an extraordinary
period in the history of our Faith, a turning point of epochal
magnitude,” it stated. “This Plan acquires a special place in the
vi

Preface

scheme of Bahá’í and world history.” “[T]he Bahá’í community
is engaged in an immense historical process that is entering a
critical stage.” The Plan had but a single aim of “accelerating
the process of entry by troops,” which the House of Justice
described as “a necessity at this stage in the progress of the Cause
and in the state of human society.” The designated protagonists
of this effort—the individual, the community, and the institutions—were charged with demonstrating “more tangibly than
ever before their capacity and willingness to embrace masses
of new adherents, to effect the spiritual and administrative
transformation of thousands upon thousands, and, above all, to
multiply the army of knowledgeable, consecrated teachers of a
Faith whose emergence from obscurity must be registered on the
consciousness of countless multitudes throughout the earth.”
What began in 1996 as an imperative need became, by
2006, a dawning reality. Over the course of the decade that
opened with the Four Year Plan, and included both the Twelve
Month Plan (2000–2001) and the Five Year Plan (2001–2006),
the capacity to promote the process of entry by troops had been
distinctly enhanced. In setting the ten-year period in perspective,
the Universal House of Justice offered a vision of possibilities
for the future. “The elements required for a concerted effort
to infuse the diverse regions of the world with the spirit of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation,” it wrote, “have crystallized into a
framework for action that now needs only to be exploited.”
The Bahá’í world stands poised to make an unprecedented,
systematic advance in the process of entry by troops during the
series of Plans unfolding over the next fifteen years until the year
2021, the end of the first century of the Formative Age.
This book traces the evolution of thought in the Bahá’í world
over the critical last decade. While it provides insights into many
aspects of the Faith, there are two observations of particular
significance that can be drawn from its pages. One concerns
the nature of the process of the growth itself. That human
resources are required at different levels of capacity to sustain
progress, that these human resources must be prepared through
formal programs of training, that they are to be deployed in
accordance with plans of action focused on geographic areas of
a manageable size—these are some of the distinguishing features
of the pattern of growth that has emerged in the past ten years.
A rich description of its dynamics and the means for promoting
it, one that employs phrases such as “two essential movements,”
“stages of development,” “cycles of activity,” unfolds in the
vii

Turning Point

book. What is striking is the pace at which such a high degree
of understanding on the subject was achieved among Bahá’ís
everywhere. “Never before,” the House of Justice noted, “have
the means for establishing a pattern of activity that places equal
emphasis on the twin processes of expansion and consolidation
been better understood.”
A second observation, inseparable from the first, relates
to the shift in culture that occurred during the period under
review. The collective acknowledgement that there were no
easy formulas for accelerating the process of entry by troops
and the willingness to adopt a posture characterized by learning
opened the way for so many rapid advances to be made in such
a relatively short span of time. A mode of operation in which
the friends study the guidance, consult on the best alternatives
before them, step into the field of action, and reflect on their
experience to improve their understanding and adjust their
efforts became pervasive. It is this culture of learning that is,
perhaps, the most noteworthy development of the decade, for
it will ensure that the Bahá’í community can continually adapt
its actions to the organic needs of the Faith and to the circumstances of an ever-changing society.
The book is divided into three parts. Part I includes a
selection of thirty-eight messages from the Universal House of
Justice covering the period from 26 December 1995 to Rid.ván
2006. Part II consists of a document dated 29 October 2005
prepared by an ad hoc committee for a workshop presented
as part of the Serving the Divine Plan Program at the Bahá’í
World Centre. This section, which explores themes related to the
current series of global Plans, provides helpful commentary but,
apart from the copious extracts taken from letters written by
or on behalf of the Guardian and the House of Justice, should
not be considered a statement of authoritative guidance. Part III
contains a number of well-familiar documents that systematize
the learning of national communities in their efforts to advance
the process of entry by troops; the first was prepared for and
approved by the House of Justice, while the next three were
written at its request by the International Teaching Centre. We
hope that this compilation of messages and documents will serve
as a valuable resource, outlining the essential concepts that will
inform future activities for the expansion and consolidation of
the Faith worldwide.

26 December 1995
To the Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors
Beloved Friends,

The Four Year Plan
1.1

1.2

1.3

Our deliberations on the Four Year Plan have benefited
enormously from the analysis the International Teaching Centre
prepared for us of conditions in the Bahá’í world, based on its
constant interaction with the Counsellors in the field, and from
our subsequent consultations with that body. It gives us great
pleasure to share with you at the outset of this conference the
general features of the Plan. We invite you to turn your attention in the coming days to issues related to implementation,
drawing on the insights and knowledge gained from decades of
experience around the world.
Certain elements of our decisions and comments on the Plan
will have a direct bearing on your labors throughout your present term of service. These are: the principal focus of the coming
Plan; the process we envisage for the elaboration of the Plan and
your part in this process; developments in the mode of functioning of the Continental Boards of Counsellors; the formulation
of plans at the national, regional and local levels; the vital need
for institutes to train believers and develop human resources;
the intimate involvement of Counsellors and Auxiliary Board
members in the establishment and operation of these institutes;
effective approaches to the raising up and consolidation of
Local Spiritual Assemblies and the development of local Bahá’í
communities; and the allocation of limited financial resources to
the many challenges before the Bahá’í community.
At Rid.ván 1996, the Bahá’ís of the world will embark
on a global enterprise aimed at one major accomplishment:
a significant advance in the process of entry by troops. This


1.1

1.2

1.3

Turning Point

is to be achieved through marked progress in the activity and
­development of the individual believer, of the institutions,
and of the local community. That an advance in this process
depends on the progress of all three of these intimately
­connected participants is abundantly clear. The next four years
must witness a dramatic upsurge in effective teaching activities
undertaken at the initiative of the individual. Thousands upon
thousands of believers will need to be aided to express the vitality of their faith through constancy in teaching the Cause and
by supporting the plans of their institutions and the endeavors
of their communities. They should be helped to realize that
their efforts will be sustained by the degree to which their
inner life and private character “mirror forth in their manifold
aspects the splendor of those eternal principles proclaimed by
Bahá’u’lláh.” An acceleration in the tempo of individual teaching must necessarily be complemented by a multiplication in
the number of regional and local teaching projects. To this end
the institutions should be assisted in increasing their ability to
consult according to Bahá’í principles, to unify the friends in a
common vision, and to use their talents in service to the Cause.
Furthermore, those who enter the Faith must be integrated into
vibrant local communities, characterized by tolerance and love
and guided by a strong sense of purpose and collective will,
environments in which the capacities of all components—men,
women, youth and children—are developed and their powers
multiplied in unified action.

Planning Process
1.4

1.5

At the close of this conference, we intend to announce to
the Bahá’í world our decision to launch a Four Year Plan at
Rid.ván 1996. The formulation of national plans is to begin in
each country after Rid.ván, allowing the friends to concentrate
their energies in the intervening months on bringing the Three
Year Plan to a successful conclusion.
The ideas expressed in the initial announcement will
be elaborated further in the forthcoming Rid.ván message.
Moreover, we have decided to address messages to the believers
in each continent of the globe, or parts thereof, exploring the
implications of the Four Year Plan in the light of the particular
conditions of their countries. Following Rid.ván, it should be
feasible to hold consultative meetings among the institutions


1.4

1.5

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

1.6

and with active supporters of the Faith in every country and to
formulate national plans within a period of a few months. Once
consultations between the Counsellors and a National Spiritual
Assembly on the provisions of a plan have reached fruition,
its implementation can begin. Approval of these plans from
the Bahá’í World Centre will not be necessary; copies should,
nonetheless, be forwarded to it.
The seven objectives specified for the Six Year and Three
Year Plans describe interacting processes that must advance
simultaneously over many decades.† They will guide the institutions as they set goals in various areas of activity to further
the aim of the Four Year Plan. National plans, however, will
need to go beyond the mere enumeration of goals to include
an analysis of approaches to be adopted and lines of action to
be followed, so that the friends will be able to set out on their
endeavors with clarity of mind and decisiveness.

1.6

Continental Level
1.7

1.8

In the discharge of their vital responsibilities during the
Four Year Plan, the Continental Boards of Counsellors will
have a wide range of possibilities available to them. The flexibility inherent in their functioning must be fully exploited
at this time when events both within and outside the Bahá’í
community are moving at an accelerated rate.
Certain Counsellor functions, including the supervision
and guidance of the Auxiliary Board members in an area, are
generally best performed by one Counsellor on behalf of the
Board. However, in the performance of other functions, there
† “For ease of reference, the objectives as originally stated are
repeated here: 1. Carrying the healing Message of Bahá’u’lláh to
the generality of mankind; 2. Greater involvement of the Faith
in the life of human society; 3. A worldwide increase in the
translation, production, distribution and use of Bahá’í literature;
4. Further acceleration in the process of the maturation of
local and national Bahá’í communities; 5. Greater attention to
universal participation and the spiritual enrichment of individual
believers; 6. A wider extension of Bahá’í family life; and 7. The
pursuit of projects of social and economic development in wellestablished Bahá’í communities.” The Universal House of Justice,
from a letter dated 30 September 1992 to all National Spiritual
Assemblies introducing the Three Year Plan.



is great value in a diversity of approaches and in consultation
among several Counsellors. For example, in providing stimulus
to National Assemblies, in promoting teaching among various
strata of the population, and in counseling different components of the Bahá’í community, better results are achieved
when the abilities of a number of Counsellors are used in a
complementary fashion. Further ways and means should be
devised by each Continental Board of Counsellors to enable
the Assemblies and communities to benefit, to the extent
feasible, from the varied talents of the Counsellors. This may
well involve periodic in-depth consultation among a group
of Counsellors on the conditions and needs of countries in a
specific part of the continent since, in general, circumstances
do not allow such consultations to occur frequently among all
members of the Board.
Fundamental to the work of the Counsellors is the understanding that all members of the Continental Board are
responsible for the entire continent, and should, to the degree
possible, endeavor to familiarize themselves with the conditions of the Cause in the countries therein. Through periodic
reports from individual Counsellors, the Board is kept abreast
of developments in all areas of the continent and is able to
offer guidance to assist its members in the execution of their
duties. Whereas no Counsellor should be regarded as having
exclusive responsibility for any one territory, the detailed
familiarity acquired by each through close interaction with the
National Spiritual Assembly and Auxiliary Board members in a
particular area is in fact a valuable asset to all the Counsellors
on the Board.
Another aspect of the work of the Counsellors which
merits further attention is the interaction between Counsellors
of different Boards who serve adjacent areas or areas which
have a special relationship. Among the examples which come
to mind are the Russian Federation, located partly in Europe
and partly in Asia; the circumpolar national Bahá’í communities; the countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea; ­ the
­communities of Northeastern Asia and the Antipodes, referred
to by the Guardian as constituting a spiritual axis; the Arabicspeaking countries of North Africa and the Middle East; and
French-speaking territories in various continents.
We hope that, while in the Holy Land, each Board will be
able to give consideration to its mode of operation and explore


1.9

1.10

1.11

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

effective means of interaction among the Counsellors. In this
way, between the close of the conference and Rid.ván, groups of
Counsellors will be able to consult together about the planning
process in a number of related countries and the role they and
their auxiliaries are to play in it.

National and Regional Levels
1.12

1.13

1.14

In most countries, once the major elements of the national
plan have been identified, it is desirable that the planning process
move quickly to the regional level. The resulting plans should
include provisions for the promotion of individual teaching,
the launching of campaigns of various kinds, the holding of
conferences, the establishment of local and regional projects,
the strengthening of local communities, and the movement of
traveling teachers. Moreover, the widespread distribution of
literature and audiovisual materials must be given urgent attention, and, particularly in areas of large-scale expansion, human
resource development must be a key component of national and
regional plans.
During the Nine Year Plan, the Universal House of Justice
called upon National Spiritual Assemblies in countries where
large-scale expansion was taking place to establish teaching
institutes to meet the deepening needs of the thousands who
were entering the Faith. At that time, the emphasis was on
acquiring a physical facility to which group after group of
newly enrolled believers would be invited to attend deepening
courses. Over the years, in conjunction with these institutes,
and often independent of them, a number of courses—referred
to, for example, as weekend institutes, five-day institutes, and
nine-day institutes—were developed for the purpose of helping
the friends gain an understanding of the fundamental verities
of the Faith and arise to serve it. These efforts have contributed
significantly to the enriching of the spiritual life of the believers
and will undoubtedly continue in the future.
With the growth in the number of enrollments, it has become apparent that such occasional courses of instruction and
the informal activities of community life, though important,
are not sufficient as a means of human resource development,
for they have resulted in only a relatively small band of active
­supporters of the Cause. These believers, no matter how dedicated, no matter how willing to make sacrifices, cannot attend


1.14

Turning Point

to the needs of hundreds, much less thousands, of fledgling
local communities. Systematic attention has to be given by
Bahá’í institutions to training a significant number of believers
and assisting them in serving the Cause according to their Godgiven talents and capacities.
The development of human resources on a large scale
requires that the establishment of institutes be viewed in a
new light. In many regions, it has become imperative to create
institutes as organizational structures dedicated to systematic
training. The purpose of such training is to endow ever-­growing
contingents of believers with the spiritual insights, the knowledge, and the skills needed to carry out the many tasks of
accelerated expansion and consolidation, including the teaching
and deepening of a large number of people—adults, youth
and children. This purpose can best be achieved through wellorganized, formal programs consisting of courses that follow
appropriately designed curricula.
As an agency of the National Spiritual Assembly, the training institute should be charged with the task of developing
human resources in all or part of a country. The requirements
of expansion and consolidation in the country or region will
dictate the complexity of its organization. In some instances,
the institute may consist of a group of dedicated believers with
a well-defined program and some administrative arrangement
that enables it to offer regular training courses. In many cases,
in addition to a group of teachers associated with it, the institute will require part- and full-time staff, for whom assistance
from the funds of the Faith may be necessary. The institute
needs access to some physical facilities in which it can conduct
courses and, at some stage of its development, may require a
building of its own. Irrespective of whether or not an institute
has its own physical facilities, its teachers must offer courses
both at a central location and in the villages and towns so that
an appreciable number of believers can enter its programs. The
complexity and number of courses offered by an institute, as
well as the size of its staff and the pool of teachers from which
it draws, may call for the appointment of a board to direct its
affairs. When the region under the influence of an institute is
large, it may have branches serving specific areas, each with its
own administration.
For the new thrust in the establishment of institutes
to ­ succeed, the active involvement of the Counsellors and


1.15

1.16

1.17

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

1.18

1.19

Auxiliary Board members in their operation is essential. Such
involvement will help the Counsellors to kindle “the Fire of
the Love of God in the very hearts and souls of His servants,”
“to diffuse the Divine Fragrances,” “to edify the souls of
men,” “to promote learning,” and “to improve the character
of all men.” These institutes will provide the Counsellors and
Auxiliary Board members with immediate access to a formal
means of educating the believers, in addition to other avenues
available to them such as conferences, summer schools, and
meetings with the friends. Institutes should be regarded as
centers of learning, and since their character harmonizes with,
and provides scope for the exercise of, the educational responsibilities of the Auxiliary Board members, we have decided
that intimate involvement in institute operations should now
become a part of the evolving functions of these officers of the
Faith. The Counsellors and National Spiritual Assemblies will
need to consult on the details of the collaboration between
the two arms of the Administrative Order in overseeing the
budget and functioning of an institute and in planning program
content, developing curricula, and delivering courses. If a
board of directors is named, its membership should be decided
upon by the National Spiritual Assembly in consultation with
the Counsellors and with their full support; Auxiliary Board
members may serve on these bodies.
In addition to having a working relationship with Auxiliary
Board members, the institute must necessarily collaborate
closely with Local Assemblies and committees in charge of
administering plans and projects of expansion and consolidation. This will ensure that the institute’s programs are designed
to help raise up individuals who can contribute effectively to
such plans. However, even if these administrative bodies have
not yet developed the capacity to utilize the talents of those
being trained, the programs of the institute should be regularly
carried out. After all, the strengthening of the institutions in
a region depends, as do all other matters, on skilled and confirmed supporters of the Faith.
In developing its programs, the institute should draw
on the talents of a growing number of believers and should
also take advantage of its institutional links to have access to
resources worldwide. A newly established institute will often
utilize materials created by institutes in other parts of the
world. Gradually, those designing and delivering courses will


1.18

1.19

Turning Point

1.20

learn how these materials might be supplemented to better
suit their specific needs and will decide what new ones should
be created. The curriculum of the institute at any given time,
then, may well use a combination of materials created locally
and those that have proven successful elsewhere. As institutes
begin to flourish, a wide variety of curricula will be developed
for various training needs. We hope that, with the assistance
of the International Teaching Centre, you will be able to assess
the materials available from time to time and help the institutes
in the communities you serve to select those most appropriate
for their needs.
We are placing at the disposal of the Teaching Centre funds
specifically designated for the operation of institutes and intend
to call on National Spiritual Assemblies, according to their
circumstances, to pay particular attention to the development
of institutes in their countries. It is our hope that significant
progress in this direction will constitute one of the distinguishing features of the Four Year Plan.

1.20

Local Level
1.21

1.22

The development of the local community and the functioning of the Local Spiritual Assembly have been ongoing challenges to the Bahá’í world through successive Plans. At present,
a few thousand Local Spiritual Assemblies have attained at
least a basic level of functioning. National and regional plans
will clearly have to include provision for the adoption by such
Assemblies of local plans of expansion and consolidation. To
ensure that local plans contribute to the advancement of the
process of entry by troops, you will need to call upon your
Auxiliary Board members and their assistants to work closely
with these Assemblies, both in the formulation of plans and in
their execution, helping them to shoulder the responsibility of
systematic growth in their own communities and in localities
adopted as extension goals. The community must become
imbued with a sense of mission and the Assembly grow in
awareness of its role as a channel of God’s grace not only for
the Bahá’ís but for the entire village, town or city in which it
serves.
However, in those many communities where no organized
activities are taking place, whether or not a Local Spiritual
Assembly has been elected, more basic challenges have to be
10

1.21

1.22

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

1.23

1.24

addressed, and in this the Auxiliary Board members and their
assistants must play a fundamental role. Concerted effort must
be made to help the individual believers, men and women alike,
increase their love for Bahá’u’lláh and His Cause and to bring
them together in the Nineteen Day Feast as well as periodic
meetings aimed at raising their awareness of their identity as
a community. In those localities where the participation of
women in community affairs is lagging, determined steps have
to be taken to foster such participation. Effective measures have
to be adopted so that the Local Spiritual Assembly is properly
elected year after year and consistent progress in its functioning
is made. The regular holding of Bahá’í children’s classes should
be given high priority. Indeed in many parts of the world this
is the first activity in a process of community building, which,
if pursued vigorously, gives rise to the other developments. In
all this, particular attention needs to be given to the youth,
who are often the Faith’s most enthusiastic supporters. The
establishment of these activities defines a first stage in the
process of community development, which, once attained, must
be followed by subsequent stages until a community reaches a
point where it can formulate its own plans of expansion and
consolidation.
In this context, we feel that the Auxiliary Board members
should take further advantage of the possibility of naming,
where appropriate, more than one assistant to a given community, with the intention of assigning each to promote one
or more of these fundamental community activities. We also
urge you to consult with National Spiritual Assemblies on
the experience of past endeavors to assist such communities.
Arrangements can then be made for the lessons learned from
this experience to be discussed with the active supporters of the
Faith in each region, helping them to identify the approaches
and methods applicable to their specific conditions and to set
in motion a systematic process of community development.
This process should be one in which the friends review their
successes and difficulties, adjust and improve their methods
accordingly, and learn, and move forward unhesitatingly.
In general, we feel the functions of the Auxiliary Board
members for Protection have to be clarified and their ­influence
augmented. The deepening of the friends and the proper
functioning of the Local Spiritual Assembly are essential to
the healthy growth of the community and should be important
11

concerns of the Auxiliary Board members for Protection. We
are contemplating an increase in the membership of Protection
Boards to make the number equal to that of the Propagation
Boards. It is our hope that Protection Board members will, in
turn, name more assistants to focus on issues related to community development.

Election of Local Spiritual Assemblies
1.25

1.26

1.27

1.28

In developing the Administrative Order, the Guardian
established the First Day of Rid.ván as the day when all Local
Spiritual Assemblies should be elected. During his own lifetime,
this practice was followed as the number of Local Assemblies
steadily grew to over one thousand.
In the subsequent two decades the Faith expanded greatly,
especially in the rural areas of the world, often remote and
difficult to reach. In view of this development, the Universal
House of Justice decided in 1977 that, in certain cases, when
the local friends failed to elect their Spiritual Assembly on the
First Day of Rid.ván, they could do so on any subsequent day
of the Rid.ván Festival. This permission did not apply to all
localities, but to those that, in the judgment of the National
Spiritual Assembly, were particularly affected by such factors as
illiteracy, remoteness, and unfamiliarity with concepts of Bahá’í
Administration. The House of Justice also gave permission at
the beginning of the Five Year Plan for Assemblies being formed
for the first time to be elected at any point during the year.
These provisions have enabled the believers in a large
number of localities to receive assistance in electing their Local
Spiritual Assemblies, and much experience has been gained
in strengthening Local Assemblies under diverse conditions
in a vast array of cultural settings. Nevertheless, in principle,
the initiative and responsibility for electing a Local Spiritual
Assembly belong primarily to the Bahá’ís in the locality, and
assistance from outside is ultimately fruitful only if the friends
become conscious of this sacred responsibility. As progress is
made in the training of human resources and in the development of the entire range of Bahá’í community life, the capacity
of the friends to elect their Local Spiritual Assemblies on their
own will certainly grow.
With these thoughts in mind, we have decided that, beginning at Rid.ván 1997, the practice of electing all Local Spiritual
12

1.25

1.26

1.27

1.28

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

1.29

Assemblies on the First Day of Rid.ván will be reinstituted.
We recognize that the immediate result may be a reduction in
the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies at Rid.ván 1997, but
we are confident that subsequent years will witness a steady
increase.
The National Spiritual Assemblies and their agencies on
the one hand, and the Counsellors and their auxiliaries on
the other, clearly have a duty to foster the establishment and
development of Bahá’í communities, including their divinely
ordained local institutions. This duty can be discharged mainly
through sustained educational programs which create in the
believers the awareness of the importance of the Teachings in
every area of their individual and social lives and which engender in them the desire and determination to elect and support
their Local Spiritual Assemblies. These programs should take
full advantage of the provision that has been made for the temporary formation of administrative committees of three or more
members in localities where Local Assemblies are not elected,
or where the members of a Local Assembly fail to meet.

1.29

Financial Needs
1.30

1.31

The magnitude of the tasks the Bahá’í community is being
summoned to perform during the Four Year Plan will call for
a considerable outlay of funds. The pressing demands of the
Arc Projects will continue to place severe constraints on the
International Funds of the Faith. Yet, the Universal House of
Justice will do its utmost to make available to the Counsellors
and the National Spiritual Assemblies the financial means
necessary for the discharge of the tasks of expansion and consolidation in areas requiring assistance. This will include funds
for the all-important work of the Auxiliary Boards.
As experience has shown, however, the expenditure of
money does not, by itself, bring results. The challenge before
you is to help develop in the various institutions and agencies
involved in the execution of the Plan the capacity to expend
funds in a judicious and effective manner. In addition, you must
redouble your efforts to educate every member of the Bahá’í
community—the new and the old believer, the youth and the
adult—on the spiritual significance of contributing to the Fund.
We are confident that you will give special attention to this
twofold challenge as you set out to help the friends in every

continent to win victories for the Cause during these crucial
years in the history of humanity.
Dear Friends, the few short years that separate us from
the close of the century are a period of both spiritual potency
and immense opportunity. Great responsibilities rest on your
shoulders. During the first months of the Plan you will be
making a decisive contribution to the formulation of plans that
will inspire the friends to action and will guide them in their
individual and collective endeavors. Throughout the Plan, you
and your auxiliaries will encourage the friends, stimulate the
spiritual powers latent in their hearts, and assist them in fulfilling their duties towards a Cause so dear to them. As you take
up these manifold tasks, you must constantly bear in mind that
the realization of the aim of the Four Year Plan will depend on
the rapid increase in the number of teachers of the Cause who
will bring in the multitudes, nurture them, and infuse in them
“so deep a longing” as to impel them “to arise independently”
and devote their energies “to the quickening of other souls.”
Be assured that we will remember each and all of you in
the Holy Shrines.

To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
2.1

2.2

2.3

2.4

In the wake of the dynamic spirit animating the six-day-long
Counsellors’ Conference at the World Centre, now in its final
session as we address you, we take the occasion to announce
our decision which has been the subject of their deliberations:
At Rid.ván 1996 a global plan of expansion and consolidation
will be launched, to end four years later at Rid.ván 2000.
It is this anticipation that has focused the thoughts of the
seventy-eight Counsellors from the five continents, who have
been conferring together in the presence of the Hands of the
Cause of God Amatu’l-Bahá Rúh.íyyih Khánum, ‘Alí-Akbar
Furútan and ‘Alí-Muh.ammad Varqá, the members of the
Universal House of Justice and the Counsellor members of
the International Teaching Centre. Their consultations on the
challenges and prospects facing the Bahá’í world community
have been of such caliber and content as to have emboldened
our expectations of a mighty thrust in the growth and development of that community during the crucial years immediately
ahead.
The whole Plan will be announced at Rid.ván. However, we
wish you to have some information about it now within the
measure of the discussions which have been taking place at the
Counsellors’ Conference.
The Four Year Plan will aim at one major accomplishment:
a significant advance in the process of entry by troops. This
is to be achieved through marked progress in the activity and
development of the individual believer, of the institutions,
and of the local community. Keen attention to all three will
ensure a greatly expanded, visibly united, vibrant and cohesive
international community by the end of the twentieth century.
The basic requisites can be summarized as follows.
15

2.1

2.2

2.3

2.4

Turning Point
2.5

2.6

The first calls for a vitality of the faith of each believer
that is expressed through personal initiative and constancy
in teaching the Cause to others, and through conscientious,
individual effort to provide energy and resources to upbuild
the community, to uphold the authority of its institutions,
and to support local and regional plans and teaching projects.
The second requires that local and national Bahá’í institutions
evolve more rapidly into a proper exercise of their responsibilities as channels of guidance, planners of the teaching work,
developers of human resources, builders of communities, and
loving shepherds of the multitudes. The third, the flourishing
of the community especially at the local level, demands a
significant enhancement in patterns of behavior by which the
collective expression of the virtues of the individual members
and the functioning of the Spiritual Assembly is manifest in the
unity and fellowship of the community and the dynamism of
its activity and growth.
Towards these ends, the work of the Continental
Counsellors must assume new dimensions. Thus, at their
conference, they have been deliberating on such matters as:

2.5

2.6

2.7



Developments in the mode of the functioning of the
Continental Boards of Counsellors.

2.7

2.8



The process for the elaboration of the Plan through the formulation of derivative plans and strategies at the national,
regional, and local levels. Joint consultations between the
Continental Counsellors and National Spiritual Assemblies
will begin immediately after Rid­.ván, and the planning
process will move quickly to the regional level, involving
Auxiliary Board members, Local Spiritual Assemblies and
committees.

2.8

2.9



The development of human resources to meet the needs
of a rapidly expanding community. Large-scale growth
necessitates sustained measures of consolidation. The
urgent requirement is for formally conducted programs of
training through institutes and other centers of learning, in
the establishment and operation of which the Counsellors
and Auxiliary Board members will become more intimately
involved.

2.9

2.10



Effective approaches to the raising up and consolidation of
Local Spiritual Assemblies. In accordance with the objective

2.10

16

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

of fostering the maturation of these Assemblies, a greater
­effort is required to uphold a vital principle, which is that
the responsibility for electing a Local Spiritual Assembly
rests primarily on the Bahá’ís in the locality. The Auxiliary
Board members and their assistants are to increase their
­e fforts to improve the general understanding of this
principle and will devote more attention to assisting the
development of Local Assemblies. As of Rid.ván 1997, all
Local Spiritual Assemblies throughout the world will have
to be elected on the First Day of Rid.ván.
2.11



Further means for the development of local Bahá’í communities. The needs in this respect will be met in part by an immediate increase in the membership of the Auxiliary Boards
for Protection to equal that of the Auxiliary Boards for
Propagation, so that Protection Board members can directly
and systematically assist on a wide scale the fundamental
activities of the community, such as the spiritual nurturing
of individual believers, the participation of women in all
aspects of community life, the observance of the Nineteen
Day Feasts and Holy Days, the holding of children’s classes,
the fostering of youth activities.

2.11

2.12

The seven objectives specified in previous Plans describe
essential, interacting directions that must advance simultaneously into the foreseeable future. The Four Year Plan’s aim at
accelerating the process of entry by troops identifies a necessity
at this stage in the progress of the Cause and in the state of
human society. With this perspective, the three inseparable
participants in the evolution of the new World Order—the
individual, the institutions, and the community—must now
demonstrate more tangibly than ever before their capacity and
willingness to embrace masses of new adherents, to effect the
spiritual and administrative transformation of thousands upon
thousands, and, above all, to multiply the army of knowledgeable, consecrated teachers of a Faith whose emergence from
obscurity must be registered on the consciousness of countless
multitudes throughout the earth. These are among the detailed
considerations that have occupied the deliberations of the
Continental Counsellors, who, upon their return home and in
the course of their work, will have occasion to share the results
of their conference with the friends.

2.12

17

Turning Point
2.13

2.14

An auspicious beginning for the new Plan will largely
­depend on the results of the current one, which will end in just
a few months. The adequacy of these results will owe much
to the degree to which the Local Spiritual Assemblies and the
friends carry out the directions of their National Spiritual
Assemblies, the generals of every Plan. Time is slipping away.
This reality should prod us all to maximum action. Hence, in
preparation for what beckons us on the near horizon, we cannot, we must not, hesitate to expend every energy to bring the
Three Year Plan to a successful conclusion. The urgency which
intensifies our desire for such an outcome is not merely pride
of victory, gratifying as that may be. There are divine deadlines
to be met. Our work is intended not only to increase the size
and consolidate the foundations of our community, but more
particularly to exert a positive influence on the affairs of the
entire human race. At so crucial a moment in world affairs, we
must not fail in our duty to take timely action on the goals set
before us in the Three Year Plan.
With the full fervor of our expectant hearts, we call upon
you all, individually and collectively, to arise to the summons
of the Lord of Hosts to teach His Cause. Do so with love, faith
and courage; and the doors of heaven will open wide to pour
forth benedictions upon your efforts.

the Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors
came to a close in the Holy Land, while the Bahá’í world was
being informed of our decision to initiate a Four Year Plan at

released through these momentous events by focusing your
attention during the next few days on the opportunities available to the Bahá’í youth, both individually and collectively, to
contribute to the successful conclusion of the Three Year Plan
and to ensure that the victories won will lend a substantial
impetus to the work of the Faith during the last years of the
Twentieth Century.
At every stage of the growth of the Faith, young people have
played a pivotal role in its propagation and consolidation. You
have the bounty of being youth at a unique time in history. Like
the generations before you, you must seize the opportunities
that the hour has thrust upon you. These are the years during
which the Bahá’í community must make a significant advance

is imperative that you take up your responsibility to lead not
only your peers but all people towards the world civilization
of Bahá’u’lláh.
You must equip yourselves for the tasks you are being

To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
4.1

4.2

Our hearts overflowing with gratitude to the Blessed Beauty,
we acknowledge the abundant manifestations of His grace
during the Three Year Plan, which has run its course with the
advent of this Rid.ván Festival. The animating spirit of the Holy
Year, which lent impetus to the launching of the Plan at Rid.ván
1993, pervaded this period of concentrated endeavor, rendering
our world community more consolidated, more resilient, more
mature, and more confident than before. At the same time, the
community’s prestige attained new heights. While this Plan has
not ended on a note of dramatic, numerical expansion, even
though significant growth of membership occurred in various
countries, it has nonetheless resulted in a qualitatively enriched
community—one prepared to exploit the immediate prospects
for the advancement of the Faith.
The magnificent progress of the projects on Mount Carmel
is preeminent among the measurable achievements of this
period. Indeed, despite numerous difficulties, the stage of
accomplishment anticipated in our message announcing the
Three Year Plan is entirely evident. All phases of construction
have been initiated. The structural framework of the Centre for
the Study of the Texts and the Extension to the International
Archives Building has been raised up and the work on these
buildings has advanced towards initiation of the exterior and
interior finishing work. The erection of the permanent seat of
the International Teaching Centre, the third structure currently
being built on the Arc, is progressing rapidly. Seven terraces
below the Shrine of the Báb are now completed, foreshowing
the unfolding splendor from the foot to the ridge of God’s Holy
Mountain. A watchful public is awed at the tapestry of beauty
spreading over the mountainside.

The physical reality of the progress thus far so ­marvelously
realized is proof of an even more profound achievement,
namely, the unity of purpose effected throughout our global
community in the pursuit of this gigantic, collective enterprise.
The intensity of the interest and support it has evoked has
­expressed itself in an unprecedented outpouring of contributions, reflecting a level of sacrifice that bespeaks the quality of
faith and generosity of heart of Bahá’u’lláh’s lovers throughout
the planet. That contributions towards the Mount Carmel
Projects have met the three-year goal of seventy-four million
dollars marks yet another measurable and exceptional achievement, inspiring confidence that the necessary financial support
for these projects will continue until their completion by the
end of the century.
The signs of progress during the past three years were
evident in a wide and varied field. The remarkable efforts to
expand and consolidate the community, the increased ventures
in social and economic development, and the unprecedented
thrust of the external affairs work combine to portray a community endowed with new capacities.
In the arena of teaching, there was a general increase of
activity as indicated by the formation of twelve new National
Spiritual Assemblies during the course of the Plan and by the
surge of pioneering and travel-teaching. Believers in many
countries were galvanized by the fresh approach suggested
in the pioneer call released during the Plan. The number of
pioneers from and to various countries was high, and there
was a veritable flood of traveling teachers operating both at
home and abroad. Systematic approaches to collective teaching
activities and well-focused long-term teaching projects were
fruitful and were more evident than ever before in a number
of countries.
The energy and creativity attendant to the various developments in expansion and consolidation owed much to the spirit
of enterprise shown by the International Teaching Centre. Its
constant direction and encouragement of the Continental
Boards of Counsellors; its recommendation of new methods
for the deployment of pioneers, as endorsed by the Universal
House of Justice in the pioneer call released in the early months
of the Plan, and its regular assistance to the Continental Pioneer
Committees placed in its charge; its unflagging attention to
the educational needs of the community as expressed in its

­interactions with Counsellors concerning the inclusion in
teaching projects of deepening programs for new believers,
the devising of courses and workshops for training in different capacities, the training of children’s teachers, and the
multiplication of children’s classes; its stimulation of efforts to
establish training institutes in different parts of the world—all
have produced resounding results. Major credit must also go
to the Teaching Centre for the influence it exerted through the
Counsellors on the adoption of core literature programs in an
increasing number of countries. Through such programs a few
titles essential to the propagation of the Faith and the deepening
of the believers were selected, printed in large quantities and
made available at reduced prices. The outstanding progress in
the evolution of this vital institution operating at the World
Centre was palpable in its preparation and conduct of the
Counsellors’ Conference last December which set the course
for the work of these high-ranking officers of the Faith during
the immediate years ahead.
A relevant development was the notable rise in the assumption of responsibility by indigenous believers for the teaching
and consolidation work in their own countries. In greatly troubled areas, such as Angola, Cambodia, Liberia, Sierra Leone,
the friends claimed important victories, whether in pursuing
teaching activities which resulted in numerically significant enrollments, or in establishing and reactivating Bahá’í Assemblies,
or in initiating and sustaining development projects. In places
with recently formed National Spiritual Assemblies, such as
countries of the former Eastern Bloc, the friends have shown an
admirable capacity for administering the affairs of the Cause. A
highlight of this period was the upsurge of vigor, courage and
creativity in Bahá’í island communities throughout the world.
The categories of activity were wide-ranging, involving the
raising up of local teachers, the training and dispatch of scores
of traveling teachers to neighboring islands, the inauguration
of primary schools, the multiple occasions for proclamation of
the Faith, the sponsorship of events attended by high-ranking
officials and influential persons. The fact that in recent years a
number of government leaders of island nations have visited the
Bahá’í World Centre is indicative of the vitality of the activities of the believers in these small lands scattered throughout
the seven seas. Taken together, all the foregoing examples of
the attitudes and efforts of the friends in different settings

­demonstrate a heightened commitment to the teaching work
and a growing maturity and resilience reflective of the depth of
faith motivating Bahá’ís from diverse populations.
Consonant with these observations were the outstanding
contributions of the youth to expansion and consolidation.
Their activities took on added dimensions during the three-year
period. Actuated by youth conferences and other gatherings
attentive to their interests, youth throughout the world invested
immense amounts of time, energy and zeal in the teaching work
as traveling teachers within and outside their countries and
as teams in collective teaching projects and, in so doing, they
stimulated hundreds of new enrollments and the formation
of many Local Spiritual Assemblies; involvement of youth in
music and the arts as a means of proclaiming and teaching the
Cause distinguished their exertions in many places; the spread
of dance and drama workshops was particularly effective;
participation of youth in external affairs opened new possibilities for the Faith in this field; commitment to a year of service
was more widely demonstrated; at the same time there was
a notable increase in the number of youth acquiring formal
training and achieving academic, professional and vocational
excellence—altogether an indication that the youth are doing
more in direct service to the Faith while at the same time
contributing to the general development of society.
Signs of the consolidation of the community were also discernible in the greater involvement of the friends in social and
economic development, particularly in the field of education.
In one outstanding instance, a government asked the Bahá’ís to
take responsibility for the management of seven public schools,
and they did so with the backing of the Office of Social and
Economic Development at the World Centre. Worthy of note is
that in Africa Bahá’í communities in exile because of political
unrest in their home country continued to develop farming and
other projects that went far towards ensuring self-sufficiency.
Efforts at improving the status of women gathered momentum
in a number of countries where, in addition to Bahá’í participation in projects sponsored by other organizations, the Bahá’í
institutions set up committees and offices to attend to the
interests of women. The Bahá’í International Community’s
Office for the Advancement of Women emerged as a symbol of
this upswing.

In a number of countries, too, there was significant Bahá’í
participation in government-sponsored programs to improve
health; in other instances Bahá’í groups initiated such ­programs
and carried them out. The work in social and economic
development was also distinguished by the firm establishment
and consolidation of a number of major projects and organizations. Three pilot literacy projects were begun as a first step in
a literacy campaign which the Office of Social and Economic
Development intends to extend throughout the world. The
Bahá’í initiation and involvement in development projects
also resulted in proclamation of the Faith as they attracted the
participation of the public and the interest of mass media.
A thrust in the external affairs work exceeding all previous
records for a similar period boosted the proclamation of the
Cause. A prodigy of effort in all parts of the world redounded
to a much greater visibility of the Faith than obtained before
and to a consequent rise in the prestige of the Bahá’í international community. The broad lines of progress were evident
in the ease with which Bahá’í communities, large and small,
sponsored or participated in public events; in the emergence
of the Bahá’ís as a force in society recognized by governmental
and nongovernmental organizations and many prominent
persons; in the ready accessibility of the media. Indeed, the wide
coverage accorded Bahá’í events and interests by the print and
electronic communications media was beyond calculation.
In the sweep of activities throughout the world, certain
specific developments stood out: the frequency with which high
public officials would invite Bahá’ís to participate in or assist
with events or projects; the successful initiatives of Bahá’ís in
influencing government action; the establishment of Bahá’í
academic programs and courses in colleges and universities
and the adoption of curricular material for public schools; the
use of the arts by Bahá’í institutions, groups and individuals in
proclamation events.
During 1995, two major United Nations events exemplified
the gathering momentum of an emerging unity of thought in
world undertakings, and these engaged the active attention and
participation of the Bahá’í community. First, the World Summit
for Social Development in Copenhagen during March involved
250 friends from more than 40 countries who mounted an
impressive effort to acquaint the summit participants and the
related NGO Forum with the Teachings. It was on this occasion
25

4.13

4.14

that the statement “The Prosperity of Humankind,” produced
by the Bahá’í International Community’s Office of Public
Information, was first distributed and discussed. Follow-up
activities all over the world included the holding of conferences and seminars, as well as the distribution of the statement.
Second, the Fourth World Conference on Women and the concomitant NGO Forum held in Beijing during September drew the
attendance of more than 500 Bahá’ís from around the world,
in addition to the official delegation of the Bahá’í International
Community. In that same year, a third event, the observance
of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations, prompted
the Bahá’í International Community’s United Nations Office
to produce and distribute a statement, entitled “Turning Point
for All Nations,” containing proposals for the development of
that world organization.
Also of particular note among the external affairs activities
were two occasions involving the prominent participation of
Amatu’l-Bahá Rúh.íyyih Khánum. Last spring she headed the
delegation of the four official Bahá’í representatives to the
Summit on the Alliance between Religions and Conservation,
patronized by His Royal Highness Prince Philip and held
at Windsor Castle. During October Rúh.íyyih Khánum was
the keynote speaker at the Fourth International Dialogue
on the Transition to Global Society held under the auspices
of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) and organized by the Bahá’í Chair for
World Peace and the Department of History at the University
of Maryland.
Nor can we neglect to mention certain other significant
marks of the period under review. An edition of the Kitáb-iAqdas in the original Arabic was published with, for the first
time, notes in Persian, supplementing the text as in the English
edition. The Law of H
. uqúqú’lláh became more deeply rooted
in the hearts of the believers throughout the world, and during
the final year of the Plan, the Trustee of H
. uqúqú’lláh, Hand of
the Cause of God ‘Alí-Muh.ammad Varqá, took up residence in
the Holy Land. This significant step also means that all three
Hands of the Cause of God—Amatu’l-Bahá Rúh.íyyih Khánum,
Mr. ‘Alí-Akbar Furútan, and Dr. Varqá—are now residing at the
World Centre, bringing inspiration to pilgrims and visitors, and
to the friends serving at the World Centre.

It is against such a background of heartening developments
that we embark at this Rid.ván upon a Four Year Plan that will
carry us to Rid.ván 2000. We earnestly and lovingly call upon
our brothers and sisters of every land to join us in a mobilization
of effort that will ensure to generations of the fast-approaching
twenty-first century an abundant and lasting legacy.
The Four Year Plan aims at one major accomplishment:
a significant advance in the process of entry by troops. As
we have stated earlier, such an advance is to be achieved
through marked progress in the activity and development of
the individual believer, of the institutions, and of the local
community.
The phrase “advance in the process of entry by troops”
accommodates the concept that current circumstances demand
and existing opportunities allow for a sustained growth
of the Bahá’í world community on a large scale; that this
upsurge is necessary in the face of world conditions; that
the three constituent participants in the upbuilding of the
Order of Bahá’u’lláh—the individual, the institutions, and the
­community—can foster such growth first by spiritually and
mentally accepting the possibility of it, and then by working
towards embracing masses of new believers, setting in motion the means for effecting their spiritual and administrative
training and development, thereby multiplying the number
of knowledgeable, active teachers and administrators whose
involvement in the work of the Cause will ensure a constant
influx of new adherents, an uninterrupted evolution of Bahá’í
Assemblies, and a steady consolidation of the community.
Moreover, to advance the process implies that that process
is already in progress and that local and national communities
are at different stages of it. All communities are now tasked to
take steps and sustain efforts to achieve a level of expansion
and consolidation commensurate with their possibilities. The
individual and the institutions, while operating in distinctive
spheres, are summoned to arise to meet the requirements of this
crucial time in the life of our community and in the fortunes of
all humankind.
The role of the individual is of unique importance in the
work of the Cause. It is the individual who manifests the vitality of faith upon which the success of the teaching work and the
development of the community depend. Bahá’u’lláh’s command
to each believer to teach His Faith confers an inescapable
27

4.16

4.17

4.18

4.19

4.20

Turning Point

4.21

4.22

responsibility which cannot be transferred to, or assumed by,
any institution of the Cause. The individual alone can exercise
those capacities which include the ability to take initiative, to
seize opportunities, to form friendships, to interact personally
with others, to build relationships, to win the cooperation
of others in common service to the Faith and society, and to
convert into action the decisions made by consultative bodies.
It is the individual’s duty to “consider every avenue of approach
which he might utilize in his personal attempts to capture the
attention, maintain the interest, and deepen the faith, of those
whom he seeks to bring into the fold of his Faith.”
To optimize the use of these capacities, the individual draws
upon his love for Bahá’u’lláh, the power of the Covenant, the
dynamics of prayer, the inspiration and education derived from
regular reading and study of the Holy Texts, and the transformative forces that operate upon his soul as he strives to behave
in accordance with the divine laws and principles. In addition
to these, the individual, having been given the duty to teach the
Cause, is endowed with the capacity to attract particular blessings promised by Bahá’u’lláh. “Whoso openeth his lips in this
Day,” the Blessed Beauty asserts, “and maketh mention of the
name of his Lord, the hosts of Divine inspiration shall descend
upon him from the heaven of My name, the All-Knowing, the
All-Wise. On him shall also descend the Concourse on high,
each bearing aloft a chalice of pure light.”
Shoghi Effendi underscored the absolute necessity of
individual initiative and action. He explained that without
the support of the individual, “at once wholehearted, continuous and generous,” every measure and plan of his National
Spiritual Assembly is “foredoomed to failure,” the purpose
of the Master’s Divine Plan is “impeded”; furthermore, the
sustaining strength of Bahá’u’lláh Himself “will be withheld
from every and each individual who fails in the long run to arise
and play his part.” Hence, at the very crux of any progress to
be made is the individual believer, who possesses the power of
execution which only he can release through his own initiative
and sustained action. Regarding the sense of inadequacy that
sometimes hampers individual initiative, a letter written on his
behalf conveys the Guardian’s advice: “Chief among these, you
mention the lack of courage and of initiative on the part of the
believers, and a feeling of inferiority which prevents them from
addressing the public. It is precisely these weaknesses that he
28

4.21

4.22

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

4.23

4.24

wishes the friends to overcome, for these do not only paralyze
their efforts but actually serve to quench the flame of faith in
their hearts. Not until all the friends come to realize that every
one of them is able, in his own measure, to deliver the Message,
can they ever hope to reach the goal that has been set before
them by a loving and wise Master. . . . Everyone is a potential
teacher. He has only to use what God has given him and thus
prove that he is faithful to his trust.”
As for the institutions, entry by troops will act upon them
as much as they will act upon it. The evolution of local and
national Bahá’í Assemblies at this time calls for a new state
of mind on the part of their members as well as on the part of
those who elect them, for the Bahá’í community is engaged in
an immense historical process that is entering a critical stage.
Bahá’u’lláh has given to the world institutions to operate in
an Order designed to canalize the forces of a new civilization.
Progress towards that glorious realization requires a great
and continuous expansion of the Bahá’í community, so that
adequate scope is provided for the maturation of these institutions. This is a matter of immediate importance to Bahá’u’lláh’s
avowed supporters in all lands.
For such an expansion to be stimulated and accommodated,
the Spiritual Assemblies must rise to a new stage in the exercise
of their responsibilities as channels of divine guidance, planners
of the teaching work, developers of human resources, builders
of communities, and loving shepherds of the multitudes. They
can realize these prospects through increasing the ability of
their members to take counsel together in accordance with the
principles of the Faith and to consult with the friends under
their jurisdiction, through fostering the spirit of service, through
spontaneously collaborating with the Continental Counsellors
and their auxiliaries, and through cultivating their external
relations. Particularly must the progress in the evolution of
the institutions be manifest in the multiplication of localities
in which the functioning of the Spiritual Assembly enhances
the individual believers’ capacity to serve the Cause and fosters
unified action. In sum, the maturity of the Spiritual Assembly
must be measured not only by the regularity of its meetings and
the efficiency of its functioning, but also by the continuity of the
growth of Bahá’í membership, the effectiveness of the interaction between the Assembly and the members of its community,
the quality of the spiritual and social life of the community, and
29

4.23

4.24

Turning Point

4.25

4.26

4.27

the overall sense of vitality of a community in the process of
dynamic, ever-advancing development.
The community, as distinguished from the individual and
the institutions, assumes its own character and identity as it
grows in size. This is a necessary development to which much
attention is required both with respect to places where largescale enrollment has occurred and in anticipation of more numerous instances of entry by troops. A community is of course
more than the sum of its membership; it is a comprehensive unit
of civilization composed of individuals, families and institutions
that are originators and encouragers of systems, agencies and
organizations working together with a common purpose for
the welfare of people both within and beyond its own borders;
it is a composition of diverse, interacting participants that are
achieving unity in an unremitting quest for spiritual and social
progress. Since Bahá’ís everywhere are at the very beginning of
the process of community building, enormous effort must be
devoted to the tasks at hand.
As we have said in an earlier message, the flourishing of the
community, especially at the local level, demands a significant
enhancement in patterns of behavior: those patterns by which
the collective expression of the virtues of the individual members and the functioning of the Spiritual Assembly are manifest
in the unity and fellowship of the community and the dynamism of its activity and growth. This calls for the integration
of the component elements—adults, youth and children—in
spiritual, social, educational and administrative activities; and
their engagement in local plans of teaching and development.
It implies a collective will and sense of purpose to perpetuate
the Spiritual Assembly through annual elections. It involves the
practice of collective worship of God. Hence, it is essential to
the spiritual life of the community that the friends hold regular
devotional meetings in local Bahá’í centers, where available, or
elsewhere, including the homes of believers.
To effect the possibilities of expansion and consolidation
implied by entry by troops, a determined, worldwide effort
to develop human resources must be made. The endeavor of
individuals to conduct study classes in their homes, the sponsorship by the institutions of occasional courses of instruction,
and the informal activities of the community, though important,
are not adequate for the education and training of a rapidly
expanding community. It is therefore of paramount importance
30

4.25

4.26

4.27

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

4.28

4.29

4.30

that systematic attention be given to devising methods for
educating large numbers of believers in the fundamental verities
of the Faith and for training and assisting them to serve the
Cause as their God-given talents allow. There should be no
delay in establishing permanent institutes designed to provide
well-organized, formally conducted programs of training on a
regular schedule. Access of the institute to physical facilities
will of course be necessary, but it may not require a building
of its own.
This matter calls for an intensification of the collaboration
between the Continental Counsellors and National Spiritual
Assemblies. For the success of these training institutes will
depend in very large measure on the active involvement of the
Continental Counsellors and the Auxiliary Board members in
their operation. Particularly will it be necessary for Auxiliary
Board members to have a close working relationship with
institutes and, of course, with the Local Spiritual Assemblies
whose communities will benefit from institute programs. Since
institutes are to be regarded as centers of learning, and since
their character harmonizes with, and provides scope for the
exercise of, the educational responsibilities of the Auxiliary
Board members, the intimate involvement in institute operations should now become a part of the evolving functions of
these officers of the Faith. Drawing on the talents and abilities
of increasing numbers of believers will also be crucial to the
development and execution of institute programs.
As the term “institute” has assumed various uses in the
Bahá’í community, a word of clarification is needed. The next
four years will represent an extraordinary period in the history
of our Faith, a turning point of epochal magnitude. What the
friends throughout the world are now being asked to do is to
commit themselves, their material resources, their abilities and
their time to the development of a network of training institutes
on a scale never before attempted. These centers of Bahá’í
learning will have as their goal one very practical outcome,
namely, the raising up of large numbers of believers who are
trained to foster and facilitate the process of entry by troops
with efficiency and love.
“Center your energies in the propagation of the Faith of
God,” Bahá’u’lláh thus instructs His servants, adding, “Whoso
is worthy of so high a calling, let him arise and promote it.
Whoso is unable, it is his duty to appoint him who will, in
31

4.31

4.32

his stead, proclaim this Revelation. . . .” Just as one deputizes
another to teach in one’s stead by covering the expenses of a
pioneer or traveling teacher, one can deputize a teacher serving
an institute, who is, of course, a teacher of teachers. To do so,
one may make contributions to the Continental Bahá’í Fund,
as well as to the Local, National and International Funds,
earmarked for this purpose.
In all their efforts to achieve the aim of the Four Year Plan,
the friends are also asked to give greater attention to the use
of the arts, not only for proclamation, but also for the work
in expansion and consolidation. The graphic and performing
arts and literature have played, and can play, a major role
in extending the influence of the Cause. At the level of folk
art, this possibility can be pursued in every part of the world,
whether it be in villages, towns or cities. Shoghi Effendi held
high hopes for the arts as a means for attracting attention to
the Teachings. A letter written on his behalf to an individual
thus conveys the Guardian’s view: “The day will come when the
Cause will spread like wildfire when its spirit and teachings will
be presented on the stage or in art and literature as a whole.
Art can better awaken such noble sentiments than cold rationalizing, especially among the mass of the people.”
While the friends and institutions everywhere bend their
energies to implementing the requirements of the Plan, work on
the great projects on Mount Carmel will continue towards their
anticipated completion at the end of the century. By the end of
the Plan at Rid.ván 2000, the buildings for the Centre for the
Study of the Texts and the Extension of the Archives Building
will become operational; the International Teaching Centre
building will have advanced to the final finishing stage. The
section of the public road which now interrupts the path of the
terraces above the Shrine of the Báb will have been lowered and
a broad connecting bridge with its own gardens will have been
built; five of the upper terraces will also have been completed.
The remaining four upper terraces and the two at the foot of the
mountain will be in an advanced stage of development. Other
particular efforts will be pursued at the World Centre as well.
Attention will be given to such matters as the universal application of additional laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the preparation
of a new volume in English of selected Writings of Bahá’u’lláh,
the further development of the functions of the International

32

4.35

Teaching Centre, and the devising of measures for increasing
the number of pilgrims and visitors to the World Centre.
The Bahá’í world community will expand its endeavors in
both social and economic development and external affairs,
and thus continue to collaborate directly with the forces leading
towards the establishment of order in the world. By improving
its coordinating capacity, the Office of Social and Economic
Development will assist in building, as resources and opportunity permit, on the progress already made with hundreds of
development projects around the world. In the arena of external
affairs, efforts will be aimed at influencing the processes
towards world peace, particularly through the community’s
involvement in the promotion of human rights, the status of
women, global prosperity, and moral development. In the
pursuit of these themes, the Bahá’í International Community’s
United Nations Office will seek ways to reinforce the ties
between the Bahá’ís and the United Nations. Similarly, the
Office of Public Information will assist the Bahá’í institutions to
utilize these themes towards greater proclamation of the Faith.
Defense of the rights of the Bahá’ís in Iran and increased efforts
to emancipate the Faith in that country and other countries
where it is proscribed will constitute a vital part of our dealings
with governments and nongovernmental organizations. In all
such respects the Bahá’í friends and institutions are urged to be
alert to the importance of activities in external affairs and to
give renewed attention to them.
The formation this Rid. ván of two National Spiritual
Assemblies lends a propitious beginning to the Four Year Plan.
We are delighted to announce that our two representatives
to the inaugural National Conventions are the Hand of the
Cause of God Amatu’l-Bahá Rúh.íyyih Khánum, Moldova; and
Mr. Fred Schechter, Counsellor member of the International
Teaching Centre, Sao Tome and Principe. Regrettably, due
to circumstances entirely beyond their control, the National
Spiritual Assemblies of Burundi and Rwanda cannot be reelected this year. The number of these institutions worldwide
will consequently remain at 174.
Rid.ván 2000, the point at which the Four Year Plan is to be
concluded, will come many months before the end of the twentieth century. At that juncture in time, the Bahá’í world will look
back in appreciation at the extraordinary developments and
dazzling achievements that will have distinguished the ­annals
33

4.33

4.34

4.35

Turning Point

4.36

4.37

of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh during that eventful period—a
period which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá called the “century of light.” Not
the least of the accomplishments then to be recognized will be
the completion of the current projects on Mount Carmel which,
together with the other edifices on that holy mountain, will
stand as a monument to the progress which the Administrative
Order will have attained by that time in the Formative Age. The
highlight of such appreciations will, God willing, be the holding
at the World Centre of a major event to mark the completion
of the buildings on the Arc and the opening of the Terraces of
the Shrine of the Báb to the public.
Beloved Friends, we enter this Plan amid the turbulence
of a period of accelerating transition. The twin processes
prompted by the impact of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation are fast at
work, gathering a momentum that will, in the words of Shoghi
Effendi, “bring to a climax the forces that are transforming the
face of our planet.” One is an integrating process; the other
is disruptive. Out of the “universal fermentation” created by
these processes, peace will emerge in stages, through which the
unifying effects of a growing consciousness of world citizenship
will become manifest.
Towards that end, recent world developments have, paradoxically, been both shocking and reassuring. On one hand, the
disarray of human affairs produces a daily diet of horrors that
benumb the senses; on the other, world leaders are often taking
collective actions that, to a Bahá’í observer, signify a tendency
towards a common approach by nations to solving world problems. Consider, for instance, the unusual frequency of the global
occasions on which these leaders have gathered since the Holy
Year four years ago, such as the one in observance of the Fiftieth
Anniversary of the United Nations, at which the attending heads
of state and heads of government asserted their commitment to
world peace. Noteworthy, too, are the promptitude and spontaneity with which these government leaders have been acting
together in responding to a variety of crises in different parts of
the world. Such trends coincide with the increasing cries from
enlightened circles for attention to be given to the feasibility of
achieving some form of global governance. Might we not see in
these swiftly developing occurrences the workings of the Hand
of Providence, indeed the very harbinger of the monumental
occasion forecast in our Writings?

34

Even though the establishment of the Lesser Peace is not
dependent on any Bahá’í plan or action, and although it will not
represent the ultimate goal humanity is destined to reach in the
Golden Age, our community has a responsibility to lend spiritual
impetus to the processes towards that peace. The need at this
exact time is to so intensify our efforts in building the Bahá’í
System that we will attract the confirmations of Bahá’u’lláh
and thus invoke a spiritual atmosphere that will accrue to the
quickening of these processes. Two main challenges face us: one
is to mount a campaign of teaching in which the broad membership of our community is enthusiastically, systematically and
personally engaged, and in which the activation of an extensive
training program will ensure the development of a mass of human resources; the other is to complete the construction projects
on Mount Carmel towards which every sacrifice must be made
to provide a liberal outpouring of material means. These twin
foci, if resolutely pursued, will foster conditions towards the
release of pent-up forces that will forge a change in the direction
of human affairs throughout the planet.
However short the path to peace, it will be tortuous;
however promising the anticipated event that will set its course,
it must mature through a long period of evolution, with its
attendant tests, setbacks and conflicts, towards the moment
when it will have emerged, under the direct influences of
God’s Faith, as the Most Great Peace. In the meantime, people
everywhere will often face despair and bewilderment before
arriving at an appreciation of the transition in progress. We
who have been enlightened by the new Revelation have the
sacred Word to assure us, a Divine Plan to guide us, a history
of valor to encourage us. Let us therefore take heart not only
from the Word we treasure, but also from the deeds of heroism
and sacrifice which even today shine resplendent in the land in
which our Cause was born.
For some seventeen years our persecuted brethren in Iran
have demonstrated a constancy of faith and courage that has
produced a vast proclamation of the Faith, forcing it out of
obscurity. Here then is living evidence in our own time of the
potencies of crisis and victory. Please God, it may not be too
long before our Iranian brethren are relieved of the yoke they
bear and are ushered into the glories and wonders of a victory
that only the Blessed Beauty can bestow. Their experience is a

35

Turning Point

4.41

4.42

signal and an example to us all wherever we may live; for eventually, opposition, as the Master has told us, will rear its head
on all the continents. Though it may be of a different character
from place to place, it will no doubt be intensive. But, thanks
to the strengthening grace of Bahá’u’lláh and the demonstration
of steadfastness by these noble friends, we shall know how to
meet the shafts of the enemy without fear. Indeed, the Lord of
Hosts has promised to deliver to His people an overwhelming
and decisive triumph.
As humanity is tossed and tormented by the ravages
inflicted upon it by a civilization gone out of control, let us
keep our heads and hearts focused on the divine tasks set before
us. For amid this turmoil opportunities will abound that must
be exploited “for the purpose of spreading far and wide the
knowledge of the redemptive power of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh
and for enlisting fresh recruits in the ever-swelling army of His
followers.” This Plan to which we are now committed is set
at one of the most critical times in the life of the planet. It is
meant to prepare our community to cope with the accelerating
changes that are occurring in the world about us and to place
the community in a position both to withstand the weight of the
accompanying tests and challenges and to make more visible
a pattern of functioning to which the world can turn for aid
and example in the wake of a tumultuous transition. Thus, this
Plan acquires a special place in the scheme of Bahá’í and world
history. Those of us who are alive to the vision of the Faith
are particularly privileged to be consciously engaged in efforts
intended to stimulate and eventually enhance such processes.
May you all arise to seize the tasks of this crucial moment.
May each inscribe his or her own mark on a brief span of
time so charged with potentialities and hope for all humanity.
Lest you become distracted or preoccupied with the drastic
happenings of this age of transition, bear ever in mind the
advice of our infallible guide, Shoghi Effendi: “Not ours, puny
mortals that we are, to attempt, at so critical a stage in the long
and checkered history of mankind, to arrive at a precise and
satisfactory understanding of the steps which must successively
lead a bleeding humanity, wretchedly oblivious of its God, and
careless of Bahá’u’lláh, from its calvary to its ultimate resurrection. . . . Ours rather the duty, however confused the scene,
however dismal the present outlook, however circumscribed

the resources we dispose of, to labor serenely, confidently, and
unremittingly to lend our share of assistance, in whichever way
circumstances may enable us, to the operation of the forces
which, as marshaled and directed by Bahá’u’lláh, are leading
humanity out of the valley of misery and shame to the loftiest
summits of power and glory.”

Rid.ván 1996
To the Followers of Bahá’u’lláh in Africa
Dear Bahá’í Friends,

5.3

You come to the Four Year Plan with an extraordinary
­history of achievement, which indicates that you are well
equipped spiritually and administratively, and in the inherent
potential of your people, to respond successfully to the Plan’s
central aim to advance the process of entry by troops. In whatever direction south of the Sahara one may look—whether to
the eastern, western, central or southern region of the ­continent
—portents of great, imminent expansion are evident. The
torch of faith burns brightly in your hearts, setting our spirits
aglow with gladness at the scale of your attainments and the
magnificent possibilities that are now yours.
The bright hope inspired by such observations is justified
by thrilling facts. The spiritual endowments of Africa derive
naturally from the creative forces universally released by the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, but these have been marvelously enhanced by the continent’s direct associations with the Channels
of such forces: the ship transporting the Blessed Beauty on His
exile to the Holy Land touched briefly its northern shores; the
Center of the Covenant spent extended periods in Egypt before
and after His historic visit to the West. The continent was also
twice crossed from south to north by the beloved Guardian.
Bahá’u’lláh favored the black peoples by making a specific
reference to them when, as the Master testified, He compared
them to the “black pupil of the eye” through which “the light
of the spirit shineth forth.”
African Bahá’í history had its beginnings in Egypt, which
was opened to the Faith during the period of the ministry of
Bahá’u’lláh; it gathered momentum during the ministry of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá when Bahá’í localities were established in South
Africa and Tunisia. But the early effects of these spiritual
39

5.3

Turning Point

5.4

5.5

endowments became more obvious with the remarkable success
of the two-year Africa Project (1951-53) when 16 territories
were opened, bringing to 25 the total number of countries and
islands in which Bahá’ís resided; this preceded the opening of
the 33 virgin territories called for in the beloved Guardian’s Ten
Year Global Crusade, a period of astonishing development in
Africa that evoked the admiration and praise of Shoghi Effendi
as many people from different tribes entered the Cause, a number of administrative institutions were formed, and it became
possible to raise up the Mother Temple of Africa in the heart of
the continent. During the course of these rapid developments,
the African believers themselves, through sacrificial effort as
teachers and pioneers, arose to champion the Cause of God,
manifesting the profundity of their response to the Message of
the New Day.
In the countries lying to the north where programs of public
teaching cannot now be pursued, the friends have continued
for many years to maintain their posts with circumspection
and heroic fortitude. Not only have they kept the flame of faith
alive in their hearts, they also endeavor to transmit the fire of
the love of God to members of their families, including their
children and youth, in anticipation of the day when freedom
to openly proclaim their religion and conduct their community
affairs is secured.
With immense gratification we now look back over just a
few decades during which Africa attained the largest number
of National Spiritual Assemblies of any continent; moreover,
Africa’s Local Spiritual Assemblies amount to a substantial
percentage of the world’s total. The prodigious output of energy
devoted to expansion and consolidation has included major
endeavors to train the believers and to mount and maintain
development projects. As a result the African Bahá’í community
can boast of notable progress in the establishment of a number
of primary and secondary schools and training institutes. A
source of much of this energy in recent times has been the
African youth, who have increasingly demonstrated exemplary
dedication and vigor in their Bahá’í activities. In the field of
external affairs, the African community, whether in small or
large states, has shown a boldness, a creativity, and a tenacity
that have resonated in the worldwide proclamation of the Faith
and the promotion of its vital interests.

Clearly, then, Africa is poised to register a victory for the
Cause that will reaffirm its position among the front ranks
of our world community. The time is critical, and you must
act promptly to realize this prospect. We therefore urge our
African brothers and sisters to take immediate account of their
strengths, needs and opportunities, and then resolve to turn the
challenge posed by these conditions into the means of success.
You will of necessity give concentrated attention to various
plans and programs of activity if you are to advance to new
stages of entry by troops, but simultaneously certain underlying
requisites will claim your special vigilance and exertion. These
are the elimination of tribal prejudice, the transformation of
prevailing social practices, and the fostering of education.
Tribal conflict is one of the most pressing issues facing
Africa. This must be dealt with in the heart of every faithful
follower of Bahá’u’lláh and resolutely overcome through the
collective will of every local and national Bahá’í community.
Indeed, how can the lovers of the Blessed Beauty allow tribal
prejudice and rivalry to be practiced in their midst when He has
made unity the pivotal principle and goal of His Faith? Hatred
and animosity based on tribe, like those based on race, blight
the human spirit and arrest the development of the society that
accommodates them. If outside the Bahá’í community in recent
years influential persons and public officials have been able to
see the practical benefit of bringing diverse groups together
towards unity, how much more should it be possible for those
imbued with the spirit of our Teachings to strive to eliminate
within the Bahá’í fellowship the unsavory characteristics of
tribal division and disunity. It is imperative and urgent in the
current state of society for the Bahá’ís so to practice genuine
unity among themselves and in their relations to others that
they may become renowned as a new people in the eyes of all
Africans. Such a demonstration will attract divine confirmations and greatly reinforce their power to succeed in spreading
the Teachings.
Much of what distinguishes African life is to be found in
patterns of behavior displayed in the tribe and particularly
in the family. Increasingly, urban life threatens to destroy the
positive qualities of such patterns. Since change is inevitable if
progress is to be made by any African society, a primary challenge to Bahá’ís is to preserve and improve those wholesome
aspects of tribal and family custom that are in accord with the
41

5.6

5.7

5.8

Turning Point

5.9

Bahá’í Teachings and to dispense with those that are not. Such
a challenge must be embraced with the understanding that
the Book of God is the standard by which to weigh all forms
of behavior. While unwavering action is necessary, wisdom
and tact and patience must, of course, be exercised. Let it be
understood, too, that Africans are not alone in the struggle
to change certain age-old practices. People everywhere have
customs which must be abandoned so as to clear the path along
which their societies must evolve towards that glorious, new
civilization which is to be the fruit of Bahá’u’lláh’s stupendous
Revelation. Indeed, in no society on earth can there be found
practices which adequately mirror the standards of His Cause.
His own truth-bearing Words clarify the matter: “The summons and the message which We gave were never intended to
reach or to benefit one land or one people only. Mankind in its
entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath been revealed
and vouchsafed unto it. Then and only then will it attain unto
true liberty. The whole earth is illuminated with the resplendent
glory of God’s Revelation.”
The acute inadequacy of plans and programs to educate
Africa’s people poses a particular challenge to the followers
of Bahá’u’lláh in that continent, for He has emphasized the
importance of education for all; and individuals ought to be
taught at least to read and write. The education of which
Bahá’u’lláh spoke includes both spiritual and material aspects.
The lack of such education affects the ability of people to
achieve true progress. This matter should be of the keenest
interest to all segments of the community. Parents have a special
responsibility to see that their children, both boys and girls,
receive an education; and they must take care that the girls are
not left behind, since well-educated girls are a guarantee of the
excellence of future society; indeed, preference should, if necessary, be given to their education. Closely linked to this concern
is the principle of the equality of men and women taught by
Bahá’u’lláh. It is also highly desirable for adults, both men and
women, who are illiterate to participate in literacy programs, so
that gradually all Bahá’ís will be able to read the Word of God
for themselves. The Bahá’í community is not fully equipped to
undertake what responsible authorities have neglected to do for
the education of the people; however, the Bahá’í institutions at
all levels are urged to give attention to these critical needs, as
circumstances permit.

Bearing in mind these three foregoing considerations, you
can move vigorously and wisely to tackle the manifold tasks implied by the Plan’s emphasis on advancing the process of entry
by troops. An extension of your efforts to effect both expansion
and consolidation on a wholly new scale is imperative. The one
suggests a powerful outward thrust of your teaching activities
to cover the length and breadth of your countries, reaching the
remotest areas with the Divine Message. The other indicates a
drive to consolidate and multiply your gains through an everdeepening penetration of spiritual knowledge of the Faith into
the hearts of the believers, a systematic development of human
resources, and a marked improvement in the functioning of
your national and, particularly, your local institutions.
In all this exertion, the three components of the process—the
individual, the institutions and the community—must assume
their respective responsibilities. We especially expect you all
to pursue every means at your disposal that will bring about
the realization of an organic unity between the Local Spiritual
Assembly and the community, and thereby establish a sharp
contrast to the fragmentation of present-day social life. Thus,
we long to see the individual African believers arise in greater
numbers to claim the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh as their own and to
take on the requisite tasks of teaching and administering a rapidly expanding Faith. And we look for accumulating evidence
that the Spiritual Assemblies are taking to heart their God-given
mandate and are conscientiously fulfilling their obligations to
Bahá’u’lláh to foster the growth and development of vibrant
communities in which adults, youth and children are more
and more integrated and active. To fulfill these expectations is
to demonstrate to a skeptical world the power of the Faith to
hold aloft a new standard for the guidance of the nations, and
eventually to attract the disillusioned masses to the security of
God’s Faith.
What specific actions, you may well ask, would indicate that
you are fulfilling the basic requirement of the Plan in Africa?
A reply would include mention of the following. Whatever
the state of expansion in a community, take the next steps to
increase enrollments, deepen the believers and strengthen the
teaching force. Where entry by troops is in progress, intensify
your efforts to stimulate further increase in the number of believers, while at the same time conducting a program of training
that will deepen the new believers and raise up new teachers
43

on a continuing basis. Maximize action to bring families into
the Faith by encouraging individuals in their duty to endeavor
to lead as many of their family members as possible to the
light of divine guidance. Regularize efforts to teach among the
sub-Saharan Muslims. Proliferate the publication of Bahá’í
literature and audio-cassette tapes, especially in vernacular languages. Swell the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies elected
by their communities without help from outside. Support more
abundantly the Funds of the Faith. Orient believers from among
the traditional rulers to the Teachings, so that they will find
appropriate ways to serve the Faith.
Moreover, extend provisions for children regularly to
attend Bahá’í classes for their spiritual training. Give consistent attention to involving the youth in the expansion and
consolidation work and to opening channels of activity suited
to their talents and necessary for their development into mature
Bahá’ís. Increase the number and effectiveness of observances
of Nineteen Day Feasts. Expand the use of music and drama
in the proclamation and teaching work, an effort in which
Africa has already distinguished itself. Multiply plans and
programs to raise the status of women and to encourage the
active support of men in such endeavors. Extend the range of
your exertions in the fields of external affairs and social and
economic development.
You will readily appreciate, then, the emphasis placed on
multiplying the number of training institutes; for without them
it will be impossible to meet the needs of hugely expanding
communities. In some places, the friends may find it possible
to offer sites and facilities for these essential operations, which
must be located in as many areas as necessary to provide regular
and well-organized training to increasing numbers of believers.
The programs of the institutes must be designed to instill in the
participants a good understanding of the fundamental verities
of the Faith and to help them acquire skills and abilities that
will enable them to serve the Faith effectively.
Immediately after Rid. ván your National Spiritual As­
semblies will initiate efforts to formulate, in consultation with
the Counsellors, the details of the Four Year Plan, country by
country. To ensure that the Plan is broadly based and responsive to the needs of all areas of a country, the participation of
the Local Spiritual Assemblies and individuals, in evolving their

own local plans and in following the lines of action to be clearly
laid down, will be essential.
Dear Friends, we are acutely conscious of the crushing
difficulties that afflict life in Africa: the conditions that have
caused a flood of refugees on the continent, the horrors created
by ethnic conflict, the political unrest, the economic distress, the
high incidence of hunger and disease, the horrendous natural
disasters. But, paradoxical as it may seem, there exist in all
of these the very possibilities of your success. Your ability to
endure and forge ahead is reinforced in the assurance given by
the Divine Physician, Who anticipated all these conditions and
prescribed a sure remedy. His prescriptions have been placed
in your hands.
Therefore, we remind you of the noble ambitions the
beloved Guardian held for you as a people in a continent
that has “a great contribution to make to the advancement of
world civilization.” May such memories resound afresh in your
hearts, quickening your will to fulfill the major aim of the Plan
before you, and setting a pace for your actions like the urgent
rhythm of drums pulsating throughout your immensely potent,
far-stretching land.
Our ardent prayer at the Holy Threshold on your behalf is
that the divine storehouses of heaven may pour out their bounties upon you all, healing your ills, magnifying your powers,
and enabling you to achieve victory upon victory.

Rid.ván 1996
To the Followers of Bahá’u’lláh in Europe
Dearly loved Friends,
6.1

Forty-three years ago, when the European Bahá’ís gathered
at the conference in Stockholm called by the beloved Guardian
for the launching of the mighty Ten Year Crusade in your continent, you had but three National Spiritual Assemblies—those
of the British Isles, of Germany and Austria, and of Italy and
Switzerland—together with slowly developing local communities in the other countries of western Europe. In the east, cut off
by political barriers, were tiny remnants of communities which
had been raised up in earlier years and, in neighboring Turkey,
was a small, struggling national community. As the European
believers of that time contemplated the awe-inspiring tasks before them, they heard the words of the Guardian, illuminating
the historical significance of the continent in which they were to
build the institutions of Bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic World Order:

6.1

6.2

A continent, occupying such a central and strategic
­position on the entire planet; so rich and eventful in its
history, so diversified in its culture; from whose soil sprang
both the Hellenic and Roman civilizations; the mainspring of
a civilization to some of whose features Bahá’u’lláh Himself
paid tribute; on whose southern shores Christendom first
established its home; along whose eastern marches the
mighty forces of the Cross and the Crescent so frequently
clashed; on whose southwestern extremity a fast-evolving
Islamic culture yielded its fairest fruit; in whose heart the
light of the Reformation shone so brightly, shedding its rays
as far as the outlying regions of the globe. . . .

6.2

6.3

This, your continent, whose soil was blessed by the
footsteps of Bahá’u’lláh Himself, which was twice visited by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His epoch-making journeys following His

6.3

47

Turning Point

6.4

6.5

6.6

release from imprisonment, whose travelers and scholars early
responded to the dawning light of the Bábí Revelation, two of
whose governments extended the hand of succor during the
Heroic Age of the Faith, and whose nations, in recent years,
have intervened so effectively in defense of the persecuted
Bahá’ís in Iran, has amply demonstrated the capacity of its
people to rally to the banner of the Cause of God, once their
hearts are touched and their minds awakened to its Message.
In the course of these forty-three years the European
Bahá’í communities have shown great vitality. The number of
National Spiritual Assemblies has risen to thirty-four, covering
the entire continent and embracing, in the case of Russia, vast
territories as far as the Pacific Ocean. Great victories have been
won for the Faith by European pioneers in Africa, the Pacific,
the Caribbean region and Greenland. Your institutions have
distinguished themselves in external affairs. Your communities
include outstanding scholars of the Faith, musicians, artists,
scientists and those concerned with the application of Bahá’í
Teachings to economics and business. You have exerted special
efforts for the advancement of women and the strengthening
of family life. The European Bahá’í Youth Council provides
a focal point and a source of stimulation to the youth in all
parts of Europe, complemented by a network of National and
Local Youth Committees closely linked to and supported by
their National and Local Spiritual Assemblies. Now is the time
to build on these achievements, clearly focusing all efforts on
the central purpose of taking the Message of Bahá’u’lláh to a
spiritually famished population.
The first task of your National Spiritual Assemblies immediately after Rid.ván will be to formulate, in consultation
with the Counsellors, the details of the Four Year Plan, country
by country. The participation of the Local Spiritual Assemblies
and individual believers in evolving their own local plans,
and in following the lines of action to be clearly laid down,
will be essential for the successful achievement of the high
aims of this stage of the implementation of the Divine Plan of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
Europe is a continent of great variety, and each of your
National Assemblies will be studying with care the processes
and achievements required for the advancement of the Cause
of God in its area during the coming four years. Each must
consider the current condition of its community, the territory
48

6.4

6.5

6.6

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

6.7

6.8

within which it is working, and areas of potential collaboration
with other Bahá’í communities. Special attention will need
to be paid to the attainment of official recognition in those
countries where the institutions of the Faith are not yet legally
incorporated, and to raising up National Spiritual Assemblies
in certain of those independent countries and major islands,
such as the Faroes, which have not yet attained them. There
are, however, certain elements of an even wider vision which
must be considered as they apply to specific countries, groups
of countries and the entire continent.
There are areas which cry out for pioneers and traveling
teachers; the mind turns, for example, to the work among the
Sami and the other peoples of the arctic and sub-arctic areas
as far north as Spitsbergen. We contemplate the significance
of teaching the Faith in the islands of the Mediterranean, the
Atlantic and the North Sea; the continent-wide importance of
the Romany peoples, who have begun to show such receptivity
to the call of Bahá’u’lláh; the opportunity for the European
Bahá’í communities to demonstrate the salutary nature of the
Teachings in relation to minorities of every kind; the specific
tasks described by the beloved Guardian as the destiny of
certain communities, and their responsibilities in far-flung
lands where their languages are spoken; the implications of
the advancement of the Faith in Italy where is to be found
“the heart and stronghold of the leading, the most ancient
and powerful Church of Christendom”; the need to rapidly
increase the number of Bahá’í centers in the vast areas of the
Ukraine and European Russia; and, beyond this, the special
responsibilities and opportunities of the Bahá’í community
of the Russian Federation, the larger part of whose area lies
in Asia and must continue to benefit from collaboration with
neighboring communities of central, southern and eastern Asia
as well as Alaska, Canada and the United States. All these are
but some examples of the challenges which you face in the
years ahead.
The central aim of the Four Year Plan, a significant advance
in the process of entry by troops, is of especial significance for
Europe. You should have no misgivings—it is a process that can
advance in all parts of Europe, in the west as well as in the east.
All should recognize that entry by troops is an inevitable stage
in the development of the Cause. The nature of the process is
clarified in the compilation on the subject, whence it becomes
49

6.7

6.8

Turning Point

6.9

6.10

apparent that the desired outcome, a sustained entry by troops,
cannot be achieved by a mere series of spasmodic, uncoordinated exertions, no matter how enthusiastic. Confidence;
unity of vision; systematic, realistic, but audacious planning;
acceptance of the fact that mistakes will be made, and willingness to learn from these mistakes; and, above all, reliance on
the guidance and sustaining confirmations of Bahá’u’lláh will
advance this process.
The establishment of training institutes in various locations
is emphasized in the Four Year Plan because current methods,
valuable though they are, are not adequate by themselves to
meet the challenges of this new stage in the growth of the
Cause. The character and structure of the training institutes
must be adapted to the conditions of each country and region;
clearly their form in Europe will not be identical with that of
training institutes in the rural areas of India. Their essential
functions, however, will be the same. They will foster a firm
acceptance of Bahá’í identity in those who take part: the
capacity to look upon the world and its conditions from the
point of view of the Teachings rather than from the standpoint
of one’s nationality or non-Bahá’í background. They will help
to develop in each participant a deep love for Bahá’u’lláh, a
good understanding of His essential Teachings and an awareness of the importance of developing the spiritual life of each
individual through prayer, meditation and immersion in the
Sacred Writings. They will also cover such practical matters as
how to teach the Faith, for there are too many who, for lack of
confidence in their ability to do so, are hesitant to convey the
Message. The transformation that such deepening in the Faith
produces will surely inflame the hearts of the individual friends
with the longing to share this Message with those around
them, and this is the seed of all success in teaching. Those who
have attended training institutes will be able to help the other
Bahá’ís, new and old, to increase their potential for teaching,
and so to greatly increase the human resources of the Cause, in
which every believer is a teacher.
The teaching of the Faith by the friends in Europe must
increase in range; it must be varied, spontaneous and individual
on the one hand, and focused, united and mutually supportive
on the other. It must be both inspiring and practical and
must, above all, be informed with serene faith in the power of
Bahá’u’lláh. You should widen the field of your teaching work
50

6.9

6.10

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

6.11

to include the country people and the masses laboring in the
cities; people of little education as well as intellectuals in university towns. You should consciously approach every stratum
of society, adapting your methods, literature and audio-visual
materials to each audience. Both the heart and the mind need
to be fed; both spiritual force and intellectual clarity must be
recognized as vital elements of the teaching work. You have
excelled in the use of the arts for the proclamation, expansion
and consolidation of the Faith; this is a key to opening many
doors and should be encouraged and developed. Your unity,
enthusiasm, confidence and perseverance, strengthened and
guided by the power of prayer, cannot fail to act as a channel
for divine confirmations, which will be a magnet to seeking
souls.
For our part, we shall pray ardently at the Sacred Threshold
that you, who have won such historic victories in your homelands and throughout the world, will enter during the Four
Year Plan into a stage of even greater achievement, presaging
the as yet unimaginable glories destined to unfold during the
twenty-first century.

Rid.ván 1996
To the Followers of Bahá’u’lláh in Latin America
and the Caribbean
Dearly loved Friends,
7.1

7.2

As you contemplate the challenges awaiting you during
these closing years of the century, you may draw confidence
from the knowledge that your past endeavors have been
abundantly blessed by divine confirmation. Some sixty years
ago, when the Guardian had called for the establishment of
at least one center in each of the Central and South American
Republics, he wrote of “the strenuous and organized labors
by which future generations of believers in the Latin countries must distinguish themselves.” Addressing the friends
in the Caribbean some years later in a letter written shortly
after the formation of the Spiritual Assembly of the Greater
Antilles, he urged them to exert “continuous and systematic
effort,” to evince “unyielding determination” and to display
“whole-hearted consecration.” Your achievements during the
intervening decades have amply demonstrated your capacity to
meet his expectations. You have proved by the spirit animating
your efforts to be well deserving of such tributes as “staunch,”
“warm-hearted,” “eager,” “spiritually minded.”
The central concern of the plans that will guide your
endeavors during the coming four years will be to effect a
significant advance in the process of entry by troops. This challenge you will not be facing as novices. You have accumulated
through successive plans valuable experience which must now
be brought to bear on the aim of the Four Year Plan with clarity
and single-mindedness. Your success will depend on the degree
to which you can, on the one hand, intensify activity in the
areas that have already witnessed large-scale expansion and, on
the other, exploit the fresh opportunities presented to you as a
result of your growing involvement in the affairs of society.
53

7.1

7.2

Turning Point
7.3

7.4

7.5

Your numerical strength lies in those many regions where,
over the decades, intense teaching activities have been undertaken among diverse populations. Through these exertions,
large numbers from most of the indigenous tribes—singled
out by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to be the recipients of special favors and
promises—as well as people of the African, Asian and European
races, have enlisted under the banner of the Faith. As a result,
your community now boasts of a harmonious blend of groups
from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds.
Plans focusing on these areas of large-scale expansion
will necessarily seek to mobilize an appreciable number of
believers within each population not only to labor diligently
in their own local communities, but also to serve as long- and
short-term pioneers and visiting teachers in other localities.
Training programs, with which many of your communities have
considerable experience, constitute a most potent instrument
for the accomplishment of such a vast mobilization. We call
upon you, then, to support the work of the training institutes
in your countries, the more experienced among you giving
generously of their time as teachers so that courses can be offered widely and consistently. As you acquire new knowledge
and skills through these programs, you will be able to put into
practice with enthusiasm and zeal what you have learned, and
arise to shoulder the manifold responsibilities that accelerated
expansion and consolidation demand.
This mobilization will greatly facilitate the development
of local communities, a task that in the past has not been an
easy one to accomplish. Your labors in this field of endeavor
must now be systematically and vigorously multiplied, utilizing
the valuable methods and approaches that have been devised
in many of your countries in recent years. A host of dedicated
workers is needed within each population who, supported by
Auxiliary Board members, regional committees and institutes,
focus their energies on the strengthening of community after
community. Let those of you who arise, even when you can
find but a handful of believers in a locality, gather them
together, broaden their vision, and raise their awareness of the
greatness of the Cause they have embraced. Help the Local
Spiritual Assembly to launch the community on a path of systematic expansion and consolidation, bringing in new recruits
or revitalizing those who, having accepted the Faith years
ago, have seen their enthusiasm wane. Remember, moreover,
54

7.3

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

7.6

7.7

7.8

that in this process of community building the education of
children—without which the victories of a whole generation
may be lost—must be given due emphasis.
While paying close attention to areas of large-scale expansion, you should not lose sight of the fact that your nations have
undergone profound change over the past decades, resulting in
increased receptivity to the Faith in many sectors of society. You
have, in each of your national communities, developed remarkable capacity to interact with society at large. Through your
extensive work in social and economic development, especially
in the area of education, through your discourse on issues such
as the preservation of the environment and the organization
of social action, through your substantive interactions with
leaders of thought, you are developing a keen understanding of
the needs and aspirations of your peoples which enhances your
ability to present the Faith to a wide range of interests.
Together with your increased involvement in the affairs
of society, you will need to make a concerted effort to attract receptive souls from diverse groups, teaching them and
confirming them in the Faith. In this respect, the climate of
search prevailing among both the leaders and the masses in
your countries, which has emerged following the ideological
upheaval of recent years, is of special significance. Two sectors
have been particularly and differently affected and are athirst
for the life-giving waters of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation: on the
one hand, the teachers in the national school systems and, on
the other, university students and their professors. Historically,
both have exerted widespread influence in your societies, and
should you teach them systematically, you will certainly reap
abundant fruits.
In all of this great endeavor—pursuing large-scale expansion and consolidation, furthering the work of external affairs
and carrying out activities of social and economic development
—you must be driven by a passion to teach the Faith. Let
regular study of the Writings feed the flame of your enthusiasm.
Let His Words so shape your thoughts that the most pressing
obligation of your lives becomes the sharing of His Message
with others. The designation given to the Latin American
communities by the Guardian as the associates of the chief
executors of the Divine Plan has defined for you a vast arena
of service. As you take up the tasks of the Four Year Plan, keep
in mind the words of the Guardian calling on the individual

believer to “. . . shed, heroically and irrevocably, the trivial and
superfluous attachments which hold him back, empty himself
of every thought that may tend to obstruct his path, mix, in
obedience to the counsels of the Author of His Faith, and in
imitation of the One Who is its true Exemplar, with men and
women, in all walks of life, seek to touch their hearts, through
the distinction which characterizes his thoughts, his words and
his acts, and win them over tactfully, lovingly, prayerfully and
persistently, to the Faith he himself has espoused.”
We shall remember each and all of you in our prayers in the
Holy Shrines and shall beseech Bahá’u’lláh to vouchsafe to you
His unfailing protection and guidance, as you boldly go forth
to conquer the hearts of men.

As members of the North American Bahá’í community, you
enter the Four Year Plan with a brilliant record of progress in
fulfilling the mandate issued by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Tablets of
the Divine Plan. In the eight decades since you received this
mandate, your prodigious exertions have carried the Message
of Bahá’u’lláh to all parts of your continent, and throughout the
length and breadth of the planet. You have played a critical role
in the establishment of the framework of the Administrative
Order and in the sustained proclamation of the Faith. These
Tablets launched you on a worldwide enterprise which you, and
the generations to succeed you, are called upon to continue during the vast period of time stretching throughout the Formative
Age and into the Golden Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation.
In your pursuit of the provisions of the Four Year Plan
on national, regional and local levels, in conformity with the
detailed plans to be formulated in the weeks ahead, you should
constantly bear in mind the one central aim of the Plan: advancing the process of entry by troops. There can be no doubt that
this process, propelled by mysterious spiritual forces beyond
the ken of the skeptic, will in due course quicken the souls of a
multitude from every background in North America and dramatically increase the numerical strength of your communities.
Training institutes and other centers of learning are an
indispensable element of a sustained endeavor to advance this
process, and to ensure that the essential deepening of new
believers is not neglected, that they develop the necessary
skills to effectively teach the Faith, and that an opportunity
is provided for all Bahá’ís, new and veteran, to embark on a
systematic study of the fundamental verities of the Revelation
57

of Bahá’u’lláh. We look to your communities to make an
energetic response to the call for such institutes, and to develop
a wide variety of approaches fitted to the needs of the diverse
components of your population.
In one of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
exhorting the North American believers to strive to attain the
exalted station of Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh, specifies firmness in
the Covenant to be a prerequisite for this achievement. We urge
you to manifest unwavering adherence to the provisions of the
Covenant, while ever striving for a deeper understanding of its
challenging features and of its implications, which far transcend
the familiar arrangements of present society.
You are in a most enviable position to provide a mighty
impetus to the teaching work. Through the alertness and
perseverance of your institutions and the effect of your exertions, there is now a general awareness of, and respect for, the
Cause in your region, and the Faith has acquired a reputation
for universality and liberality of thought. Well may you rejoice
at this remarkable achievement, and well may you contemplate
the present needs of the Cause with eagerness and confidence.
Your accomplishments have prepared the way for even more
spectacular successes in the years immediately ahead. Now as
never before should you strive mightily to free yourselves from
the obstacles of apathy, attachment to worldly pursuits, and
lethargy, which stand in the way of so glorious a realization.
As the people around you yearn increasingly for a society in
which rectitude of conduct prevails, which is animated by a
nobility of moral behavior, and in which the diverse races are
firmly united, your challenge is to demonstrate the efficacy of
the Message of Bahá’u’lláh in ministering to their needs and
in recreating the very foundation of individual and social life.
The whole of North America stands in desperate need of the
inspiring vision, the dynamic sense of purpose and the idealism,
which can be provided only by those who are imbued with the
spirit and truths of the Bahá’í Writings.
The community of the Greatest Name must increasingly
become renowned for its social cohesion, and for the spirit
of trust and confidence which distinguishes the relationship
between believers and their institutions. In the earliest years of
his ministry, the Guardian stated, “. . . I hope to see the friends
at all times, in every land, and of every shade of thought and
character, voluntarily and joyously rallying round their local

and in particular their national centers of activity, upholding
and promoting their interests with complete unanimity and
contentment, with perfect understanding, genuine enthusiasm,
and sustained vigor. This indeed is the one joy and yearning of
my life, for it is the fountainhead from which all future blessings
will flow, the broad foundation upon which the security of the
Divine Edifice must ultimately rest.” Realization of this longing
requires that you commit yourselves to the wholehearted support of your institutions. In turn, those of you called upon to
serve as members of such bodies should ever be mindful of the
attitude and manner prescribed for the conduct of their duties,
and should strive continually to approach the exalted standard
set out in the Teachings.
In the Divine Plan bequeathed to you by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is
disclosed the glorious destiny of those who are the descendants
of the early inhabitants of your continent. We call upon the
indigenous believers who are firmly rooted in the Bahá’í
Teachings to aid, through both deed and word, those who have
not yet attained that level of understanding. Progress along the
path to their destiny requires that they refuse to be drawn into
the divisiveness and militancy around them, and that they strive
to make their own distinctive contribution to the pursuit of the
goals of the Four Year Plan, both beyond the confines of North
America and at home. They should be ever mindful of the vital
contribution they can make to the work of the Faith throughout
the American continent, in the circumpolar areas and in the
Asian region of the Russian Federation.
We direct the attention of the believers of African descent,
so beloved by the Master, to the pressing need for pioneers,
who will contribute to the further development of the Cause in
distant areas, including the continent of Africa for which they
were assigned a special responsibility by the Guardian when
the first systematic campaign was launched for its spiritual illumination. Although their contributions to all aspects of Bahá’í
service on the home front and elsewhere will be of great value,
they can be a unique source of encouragement and inspiration
to their African brothers and sisters who are now poised on the
threshold of great advances for the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.
Increasingly over the years, the Bahá’í community in North
America has been augmented by the addition of a substantial
number of believers who have come from the Cradle of the
Faith. We urge all the friends of Persian background, who
59

8.8

Turning Point

constitute a most valuable source of ability and experience, to
dedicate themselves, to an extent surpassing their past services,
to the accomplishment of the goals of the Four Year Plan, under
the leadership and guidance of the institutions of the Faith in
North America. The unity of thought and endeavor between the
friends from East and West will offer a shining example of the
power of Bahá’u’lláh to demolish traditional barriers and will
be a powerful source of attraction to the Cause.
The Alaskan Bahá’ís are privileged to live in an area
described by the Guardian as “a region destined to play an
important role in shaping the spiritual destinies of the great
Republic of the West of which it forms a part, and to contribute, in no small measure, to the establishment of the institutions
of His World Order throughout the American continent.” The
invaluable contribution they have made to the establishment
of the Faith in Siberia in recent years, together with their
significant advances in strengthening the home front, provide
compelling evidence of their capacity to take full advantage of
the opportunities before them in the Four Year Plan.
The valiant Canadian Bahá’í community was praised by
the Guardian for “the staunchness of the faith of its members,
their unyielding resolve, their ceaseless efforts, their willingness
to sacrifice, their exemplary loyalty, their steadfast courage,” a
description fully confirmed by the record of its achievements
during the Three Year Plan. It has played a disproportionately
great and much-appreciated role in the defense of the Faith, in
its propagation to all corners of the earth, and in the establishment of its institutions in other lands, both near and far, and is
in an enviable position to build upon these successes in the new
Plan on which it now embarks.
Our thoughts turn often to the Bahá’í community of
Greenland, whose staunchness of faith and dogged perseverance have won our admiration and praise, and have resulted
in the Faith’s becoming firmly established in that distant land.
Inspired by the promise set out in the Tablets of the Divine Plan
that “if the hearts be touched with the heat of the love of God,
that territory will become a divine rose-garden and a heavenly
paradise, and the souls, even as fruitful trees, will acquire the
utmost freshness and beauty,” let them now go forth to claim
new victories on the home front and to transform their nation
through the power of the Divine Teachings.

Some four decades ago, Shoghi Effendi described the
­members of the United States Bahá’í community as “the outstanding protagonists of the Cause of God; the stout-hearted
defenders of its integrity, its claims and its rights; the championbuilders of its Administrative Order; the standard-bearers of its
crusading hosts; the torchbearers of its embryonic civilization;
the chief succorers of the down-trodden, the needy and the fettered among its followers. . . .” Any survey of the distinguished
accomplishments of these dearly loved friends during the past
three years provides striking evidence of the continuing applicability of this description, and of the immense contribution
they are making to the advancement of the Cause. We look to
the members of the Bahá’í community in the United States to
perform, during the Four Year Plan, heroic deeds of service to
the Cause, which will astonish and inspire their fellow-believers
throughout the world.
In North America, there are opportunities for the advancement of the process of entry by troops, the like of which
presently exist in no other place on earth. Three unique
characteristics combine to give rise to this condition: the
unparalleled strength of your local communities, particularly
evident in the activity of your Local Spiritual Assemblies and in
the consecration of the Bahá’í youth; the positive impression of
the Faith which has been conveyed, not only to the generality
of the population, but also to leaders of thought and people
of influence; and the composition of your nations, which have
welcomed to their shores immigrants, students and refugees
from all parts of the planet, drawn from all the major racial,
ethnic and religious backgrounds of humanity. You, who live
in a continent described by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as “the land wherein
the splendors of His light shall be revealed, where the mysteries
of His Faith shall be unveiled, the home of the righteous, and
the gathering-place of the free,” are called upon to take full
advantage of these favorable circumstances.
Dear Friends, now must you commit yourselves to the work
of the Cause afresh, liberated from any doubts, uncertainties
or hesitations which may have impeded you in the past. Every
stratum of society must be brought within your embrace, as you
vigorously advance toward the goal of entry by troops at this
time when powerful spiritual forces are at work in the hearts
of the people. Neither the affluent nor the indigent should be
excluded from your purview. Receptive souls should be sought

in the sophisticated circles of urban society, on the campuses of
colleges and universities, in centers of industry and commerce,
on the farms and villages of the mountains, plains and prairies
—wherever are to be found human beings in search of the
divine Truth. You should strive to create a Bahá’í community
which will offer to the entire world a vibrant model of unity
in diversity. The influence of your exertions can extend well
beyond the confines of North America; in particular, French
Canadian believers can perform an invaluable service to the
Faith in the French-speaking nations and islands throughout
the world, the Bahá’ís dwelling in the Arctic and sub-Arctic
regions can powerfully reinforce the work of the Cause in the
circumpolar areas, and the friends of Hispanic background
have fertile fields before them throughout Latin America. Let
all believers consider the extent to which they can use familial
and ethnic ties to other regions of the world for the fulfillment
of the global mission conferred on the recipients of the Tablets
of the Divine Plan.
At this critical hour in the fortunes of humanity, our eyes
turn with eagerness and hope to the Bahá’ís of all parts of
North America, who constitute a reservoir of human and
material resources unmatched elsewhere in the Bahá’í world.
As you proceed along your prescribed path, you should be ever
mindful of these words addressed to you by the Author of the
Tablets of the Divine Plan: “I fervently hope that in the near
future the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the results
of your achievements. The hope which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá cherishes
for you is that the same success which has attended your efforts
in America may crown your endeavors in other parts of the
world, that through you the fame of the Cause of God may be
diffused throughout the East and the West, and the advent of
the Kingdom of the Lord of Hosts be proclaimed in all the five
continents of the globe.”
Our ardent prayers at the Sacred Threshold will surround
and accompany you at every step of the momentous under­
taking to which you are now summoned.

Dearly loved Friends,

You are privileged to live in a region of the world unique in
the opportunities it offers to advance the interests of the Faith
during the course of the Four Year Plan. You constitute Bahá’í
communities within, or on the fringe of, the vast Pacific Ocean,
with which is associated this promise of Bahá’u’lláh: “Should
they attempt to conceal His light on the continent, He will
assuredly rear His head in the midmost part of the ocean and,
raising His voice proclaim: ‘I am the lifegiver of the world.’”
At a time when the dear Bahá’í friends in the Cradle of the
Faith yearn for the yoke of oppression to be lifted from their
shoulders, you can compensate for their present and temporary
inability to propagate the Faith if you undertake a sustained
endeavor to convey the Divine Message to the peoples of your
countries and multiply Bahá’í institutions throughout these
lands.
Within your region is to be found a vast diversity of races,
cultures, languages and religious traditions, illustrative of the
major influences which have shaped the affairs of humanity
throughout history. One of this region’s distinguishing features
is described by the Guardian as “a spiritual axis, extending from
the Antipodes to the northern islands of the Pacific Ocean—an
axis whose northern and southern poles will act as powerful
magnets, endowed with exceptional spiritual potency, and
63

9.1

9.2

Turning Point

9.3

9.4

9.5

towards which other younger and less experienced communities
will tend for some time to gravitate.” This emphasizes the vital
role to be played by the Bahá’í communities of Northeastern
Asia and of the Antipodes in the spiritual illumination of the
surrounding areas.
Every country of the region must witness, in the course of
the Four Year Plan, a significant advance in the process of entry
by troops. It is essential that the plans formulated on national
and local levels reflect this vital aim. The advancement of this
process will require that greater attention be given not only to
fostering individual initiative in the teaching work, but also
to developing human resources through the establishment and
efficient operation of training institutes and other centers of
learning, and to vastly increasing the strength and quality of
the functioning of the Local Spiritual Assemblies.
We direct a special appeal to the indigenous believers in all
parts of the Pacific region, men and women alike, to intensify
their efforts to acquire a deeper understanding of the Revelation
of Bahá’u’lláh, and to strive for a position in the forefront of
the promoters of the Faith through their teaching endeavors on
the home front and their international cooperation in programs
of the Ocean of Light. As the tensions and divisions of a declining social order increase, the believers throughout the Pacific
Islands should provide compelling testimony to the potency of
the Bahá’í Teachings through their manifest unity transcending
tribal, national or ethnic barriers. The desperate search for
solutions to the social and economic problems afflicting these
countries is tempting people, in increasing numbers, to indulge
in partisan political activities; the indigenous Bahá’ís should
refuse to be drawn into such divisive pursuits and should strive
to acquire a more profound insight into the nature of the World
Order of Bahá’u’lláh, which offers a pattern for a future society
distinguished by justice and unity, far removed from the contention of competing political interests.
In many of the nations of your area, women have traditionally been restricted to a secondary role in the life of society.
We call upon the Bahá’í women of these countries, assured of
the support and encouragement of all elements of the Bahá’í
community, to demonstrate the transforming power of this
Revelation by their courage and initiative in the teaching work
and their full participation in the administrative activities of
the Faith.

In much of the region, insufficient attention has been given
to the education of children. Far more extensive programs
should be initiated in those countries where the need exists,
to ensure that Bahá’í children are nurtured, encouraged to
acquire trained minds, illumined with a sound knowledge of
the Divine Teachings, well-equipped to participate in the work
of the Cause at all levels and to contribute to the arts, crafts
and sciences necessary for the advancement of civilization.
Such programs, when open to all children, Bahá’í or not,
offer a potent means of extending the beneficial influences of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Message to the wider society.
In Northeastern Asia, the progress of the Faith has been
most encouraging, and a good foundation has been laid for the
Bahá’ís of Japan and Korea to magnify the size of their communities substantially during the Four Year Plan, while making
a notable contribution to the work of the Faith in neighboring
countries. Special attention should be given to the development
of the Faith in the Ryukyu Islands and also to the exploration
of any opportunities which might arise to carry the healing
Message of Bahá’u’lláh to all parts of the Korean peninsula.
The dedication and vitality of the Bahá’í community in the
Philippine Islands is a constant source of joy to us. We look to
the Filipino believers to make a significant advance in the process of entry by troops during the Four Year Plan, while giving
renewed attention to the strengthening of their Local Spiritual
Assemblies and the development of community life. This will
necessitate the intensive use of training institutes throughout
the country, and the involvement of a larger number of believers
in these training programs. The members of this devoted Bahá’í
community provide a welcome source of manpower for the
reinforcement of Bahá’í endeavors elsewhere, particularly in the
Asian and Pacific regions.
We are well aware of the restrictions which have long afflicted the members of the Indonesian Bahá’í community. Their
staunchness of faith, and their initiative in taking full advantage
of whatever opportunities are open to them, attract our admiration and gratitude. We urge them to continue their endeavors
throughout the whole of Indonesia, with full confidence that
their hopes will be fulfilled in the future.
A special responsibility must rest upon the believers in
Papua New Guinea, constituting the largest body of Bahá’ís in
Australasia, to strive unceasingly to build a vibrant community
65

which embraces all strata of society and which is renowned
as a dynamic and enlightened segment of their nation. We
look forward, in the course of the Four Year Plan, to a greater
participation of the Bahá’í men and women of this country in
the development of the Faith in other parts of Melanesia and
elsewhere throughout the Pacific Islands.
In Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii, there are wellestablished and soundly functioning Bahá’í communities, each
characterized by an admirable record of accomplishments on
the home front and by a notable contribution to the work of
the Faith in other parts of the Pacific and beyond. We call upon
the believers in these countries to strive for a fuller realization
of their duty to advance the interests of the Faith on the home
fronts and throughout the length and breadth of the Pacific
region. In their own countries, they should aspire to far greater
attainments, marked by a substantial increase in the number of
adherents and an enhanced public awareness of the distinctive
character of the Bahá’í Faith and its followers. They can render
invaluable assistance to other Bahá’í communities, not only in
the Pacific region but in Southeast Asia and beyond, because of
the experience they have acquired in the teaching and administrative fields and the resources to which they have access. The
believers from the Pacific Islands who have taken up residence
in these three countries should be mindful of the responsibilities which rest upon them to devise means by which they can
contribute to the strengthening of the Bahá’í communities in the
island nations from which they have come.
Many of the valiant Bahá’í communities of the Pacific
Islands are distinguished by the fact that they constitute significant percentages of the populations of their countries. The
believers in these island nations need to direct their attention,
more than ever, to the propagation of the Faith. They should
also concentrate on the development of a distinctive community
life, based on an uncompromising adherence to the precepts
of the Faith, and guided by well-functioning Local Spiritual
Assemblies, which will demonstrate to the entire populations
of their countries the unifying and transforming power of the
Faith, and will attract to the Cause a multitude of new believers. Through this effort, they can make a vital contribution to
enhancing the worldwide prestige of the Faith, and can lay the
foundation for even more outstanding victories in the future.
We urge them to give attention to sharply increasing their level
66

9.11

of international cooperation in pursuit of the goals of the Four
Year Plan, including support of the establishment of a strong
Bahá’í community in French Polynesia as a basis for the future
election of a National Spiritual Assembly there.
Almost four decades have passed since Shoghi Effendi
described the Pacific region in which you live as “that vast area
of the globe, an area endowed with unimaginable potentialities,
and which, owing to its strategic position, is bound to feel the
impact of world-shaking forces, and to shape to a marked degree through the experience gained by its peoples in the school
of adversity, the destinies of mankind.” Since that time your
nations have come ever more fully under the influence of the
forces which are causing turmoil and disorder to human society,
while the followers of Bahá’u’lláh have labored, undeterred and
with admirable dedication, to advance the Cause of their Lord
and to establish His institutions. The Pacific area, where, as the
Guardian stated, “Bahá’í exploits bid fair to outshine the feats
achieved in any other ocean, and indeed in every continent of
the globe,” now stands at the threshold of victories far greater
than any yet won. We call upon you to go forward now as
never before, assured of our ardent prayers in the Holy Shrines
on your behalf, confident of your ultimate triumph.

Dearly loved Friends,

Some four decades ago, in a message to the first Regional
Convention of the Bahá’ís of Southeast Asia, the Guardian
wrote of the “far-reaching influence” that area would exercise
on the “future destinies of the world Bahá’í community.” He
referred to the area’s “heterogeneous character” and “geographical position,” underscored “the spiritual receptivity of
many of its inhabitants,” and drew attention to “the role they
are destined to play in the future shaping of the affairs of mankind.” The remarkable progress of the Faith in Southeast Asia
since that time, in a period of social and political upheaval, is
but a prelude to the fulfillment of the Guardian’s promise. This,
taken together with the recent accomplishments of the believers
in the neighboring territories as far north as Mongolia, gives
rise to a brilliant vision of future triumphs in the entirety of
that vast region.
You now embark on the next stage of your endeavors, a
Four Year Plan whose aim is to effect a significant advance
in the process of entry by troops. Among your peoples, the
­majority of whom have been influenced by noble and highminded teachings of Buddhism, are many who possess a
profound sense of spirituality, which is reflected in the practices
of their daily lives and in the quality of their relationships with
one another, with nature, and with their social institutions.
They have a keen understanding of the need for coherence
between the material and the spiritual, and are disturbed by the
effects of gross materialism on their societies in recent years.
Your region represents a vast reservoir of potential promoters
69

10.1

10.3

10.4

of the Cause waiting to be tapped. The number and quality
of the active supporters of the Faith with which it is already
blessed bespeak the richness of that reservoir.
Systematic training programs constitute the most potent
instrument at your disposal for realizing the potential of that
highly promising region to contribute significantly to the
human resources of the Faith. To this end, the establishment
and strengthening of institutes will undoubtedly be a central
component of the plans of all your countries. Your participation in institute programs, through which you will deepen your
knowledge of the Faith, cultivate your inner spiritual lives and
develop abilities of service, will enable you to intensify your
individual and collective exertions in the teaching field and will
result in a commensurate acceleration in the expansion of your
communities. Varying patterns of growth, of course, will evolve
according to the particular conditions in each country.
In Malaysia, large numbers of believers from among the
Chinese, Indian and indigenous populations can be mobilized,
and their energies directed towards the stimulation of activity at
the local level. Many of the local communities are in a position
to implement plans and projects under the direction of their
Local Spiritual Assemblies, and they should be encouraged
and aided in their efforts to do so. The capacity to achieve
rapid and simultaneous expansion and consolidation exists in
Malaysia, but needs to be fully exercised. Such an undertaking
must be complemented by concrete measures to broaden the
range of activities in areas such as the advancement of women,
the spread of literacy, and the promotion of moral education
—areas in which the Malaysian community already has an
impressive record. In addition to contributing to the progress of
society, such activities will go far in winning the admiration and
respect of the enlightened in government circles and, beyond
that, in drawing the attention of leaders of thought throughout
the region to the Teachings of the Faith.
The Bahá’í community of Myanmar, which traces its roots
back to the time of Bahá’u’lláh, has in recent years been able
to pay increasing attention to the expansion of the Faith. The
results have been encouraging indeed. The large body of believers in Myanmar, faithful to the Covenant and with hearts filled
with love for Bahá’u’lláh, who stand ready to serve His Faith,
can be helped by the institute program now being established
there to enter the field of teaching with confidence. The effects

such an endeavor will have, in a land so receptive to the Divine
Message, are incalculable.
The friends in Thailand may draw courage from the success of their efforts to help reestablish the Bahá’í community
of Cambodia and resolve to turn with the same vigor and
determination to the tasks of expansion and consolidation in
their homeland. There they have proved themselves capable
of teaching among many strata of society and of bringing into
their ranks people of diverse cultural and educational backgrounds. Setting aside all hesitation, and with unity of thought
and purpose, let them dedicate the coming four years to the
unflagging pursuit of a clearly defined course of action traced
for them by their institutions.
In Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, where possibilities for
growth exist in varying degrees, the sorely tried, steadfast and
devoted friends need to demonstrate to the authorities and leaders of their countries that Bahá’ís, obedient and loyal to their
governments, desire but the prosperity of their nations and the
upliftment of their peoples. Through the spiritual enrichment of
families in Vietnam, through the program of deepening in small
groups now initiated in Laos, and through systematic plans
for expansion and consolidation and for social and economic
development in Cambodia, where the friends enjoy greater
freedom, each of these communities can achieve substantial
progress within the parameters defined for them by prevailing
social and political conditions.
The manner in which the Bahá’í community of Mongolia,
so young and so full of vitality, has taken its affairs in hand is
exhilarating. In the span of seven years, the friends have ranged
methodically across that vast land and have established the
Faith on solid and enduring foundations. At the national level,
they are becoming known for their high ideals, particularly as
champions of the rights of children. At the same time, their
Bahá’í classes, open to children from Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í
families alike, are being received with great enthusiasm, presenting them with extensive teaching opportunities. There is a spirit
in the Mongolian people which must needs manifest itself in the
efflorescence of a numerically strong, vibrant community.
The Bahá’í community of Singapore is energetic and dedicated. Its past experience demonstrates that focused attention
on expansion invariably brings good results. What is required
at this stage of the community’s development is an ­accelerating

increase in the number of individual enrollments. Such an
influx of new souls will continually strengthen the community
which, although comparatively small, has demonstrated its
ability to play an important role in the affairs of the Faith in
the region.
Dear Friends, any attempt to present, no matter how
briefly, an overview of the potentialities of your region must
necessarily take into account the preponderating influence that
the Chinese people are to exert on the destiny of humankind.
To them, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has referred as “truth-seeking” and
“prompted with ideal motives.” From among them, He
declared, can be raised “such divine personages that each
one of them may become the bright candle of the world of
humanity.” The progress of the Faith in Hong Kong, Macau
and Taiwan, and the labors of the Chinese believers resident in
other parts of the region, are early indications of that which is
yet to come. We turn our expectant eyes towards the Chinese
people, confident in their ability to become illumined with the
light of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation and to apply His Teachings,
with characteristic diligence, to the advancement of spiritual
and material civilization. As larger and larger numbers become
imbued with heavenly qualities, and as they make sincere exertions for the progress of their people, they shall, God willing,
win the trust of fair-minded leaders and be able to broaden
the scope of their endeavors in a land that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has
designated “the country of the future.”
We shall pray ardently at the Sacred Threshold that the
blessings of Bahá’u’lláh may sustain you and guide you in your
noble services to His Cause.

aim of the Four Year Plan. Your region, which claims a substantial percentage of the world’s people, has a Bahá’í population
that already exceeds by far that of any other area of the globe.
By virtue of its immense natural and human resources, its
magnificent history and the rich cultural diversity of its inhabitants, India plays a prominent role in the shaping of human
affairs. Throughout the history of the Faith, it has been the
recipient of countless blessings and the arena of unparalleled
triumphs. Mentioned by the Báb in the first of His Writings,
India is eternally honored to have had one of its native sons
numbered among the Letters of the Living, privileged to behold
the first rays of the Dawn of a New Day. Bahá’u’lláh Himself
selected and dispatched emissaries to propagate His Faith in
India, and, under the direction of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi
Effendi, streams of teachers from both Iran and the West continued to flow to that land to help the believers carry forward
the standard of Divine guidance.
In response to the bountiful favors conferred upon them
over the decades, the friends in India have made sacrificial efforts
for the progress of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh and have achieved
splendid victories in His Name. They first demonstrated their
ability to initiate entry by troops as early as the closing years of
the Ten Year Crusade when they enlisted thousands of receptive
souls into the ranks of His followers. The sudden influx of
new adherents to the Cause from all castes and creeds—clear

evidence of the receptivity of that great ­ nation—transformed
a small body of believers into a vibrant and broadly based
community which gradually learned to shoulder immense and
inescapable responsibilities. Its valiant members, relying on
the unfailing grace of Bahá’u’lláh, surmounted the obstacles
before them, persevered, and sustained their efforts until India
came to occupy a privileged place in the eyes of the Bahá’ís of
the world.
The Indian Bahá’í community has gone from strength
to strength. It has established the institutions of the Faith
throughout the length and breadth of that vast country, including suitable agencies to administer the affairs of the Cause in
each state; has undertaken countless projects and campaigns of
expansion and consolidation; has produced and disseminated
literature in a wide array of languages; has pursued numerous
projects of social and economic development, especially in the
field of education; and, aided by the power of attraction of its
House of Worship, has proclaimed the Faith to many millions
of people. From every standpoint—its administrative structure,
its relations with the government, its experience in large-scale
expansion, and the devotion of the active supporters of its
programs and projects—the Indian community stands in an
enviable position at the beginning of this, the Four Year Plan.
The Bahá’í community of Bangladesh, flourishing in the
midst of a Muslim society, is a source of joy to the entire
Bahá’í world. In recent years and with astonishing rapidity,
that community began to achieve extraordinary success in the
teaching field, and throughout the Three Year Plan it has sustained consistently large-scale expansion. Its institutions have
demonstrated their capacity to mobilize the human resources
at their disposal, and those who have responded to the call for
action have sacrificially and with the utmost devotion spread
the Divine Teachings among the Muslim, Hindu and tribal
populations of that country. The purity of their motives and
the sincerity of their efforts to address the needs of society
have won them recognition from government officials in the
highest circles. Their exertions to promote love and unity
among the majority Muslim and minority Hindu populations
are bearing increasing fruit, a striking testimony to the potency
of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation.
In the Himalayan Kingdom of Nepal, the believers have,

their conduct, overcome in recent years restrictions on the
expansion of the Cause. They are now held in high regard and
are successfully engaged in presenting the Faith to the people
as a unifying force which can contribute to the progress of the
nation. As they grow in strength, they can begin to look beyond
their own borders and assist in the propagation of the Faith in
those areas to which they have such easy access.
In the Indian Ocean, the Bahá’í community of Sri Lanka, a
nation with a predominantly Buddhist population, is addressing
diligently the challenges of growth. In spite of a number of
set-backs in the past, the friends have persevered and are using
the power of their hard-won unity to respond to the needs of
that sorely tried country, whose suffering people thirst for the
vivifying waters of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation. Farther to the east,
the Bahá’í community of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands has
steadily grown over the years and is blessed with sincere and
devoted believers, whose efforts won them the distinction of
having their own National Spiritual Assembly.
Dear Friends, the receptivity of your peoples and the
extraordinary advances you have already made enable you
to approach the challenges of entry by troops with vigor and
optimism, and to give systematic attention to the tasks that
must be diligently carried out to ensure accelerated growth.
Your past exploits were largely the result of the incessant
labors of a comparatively few consecrated believers who
devoted their time and resources to the spread of the Cause
in locality after locality. If you are to sustain rapid expansion
and consolidation in the coming years, it is imperative that
far greater numbers of dedicated and committed souls arise to
promote these twin processes. Training courses—widespread,
regular and well-organized—constitute the most effective
means to mobilize believers on the scale required. Depending on
the conditions of your countries, such courses will be conducted
by teachers associated with national, state or regional institutes,
some of which may well have several branches. Although the
programs of the institutes may vary according to the characteristics of the populations they serve, their essential functions will
be the same. They should seek to develop in the participants a
good understanding of Bahá’u’lláh’s essential Teachings and to
help them acquire those skills and abilities that will enable them
to serve the Faith effectively. They should also strive to imbue
their hearts with a deep love for Bahá’u’lláh—a love from
75

11.7

Turning Point

11.10

which stems a desire to submit oneself to His Will, to obey His
laws, to heed His exhortations and to promote His Faith.
While all the participants in these courses will naturally
be directed to the field of teaching, a sufficient number will
also have to acquire the ability to assist with the development
of local communities. In a region of the world where villages
constitute a major component of every nation, a concerted
effort must be made to establish in them the patterns of Bahá’í
community life on a firm basis. This can only be achieved
through perseverance and constancy in working with the local communities. The friends in each locality must be helped
to raise their awareness of the efficacy of the Teachings they
have accepted and to broaden their vision of the tasks and
opportunities before them. The Local Spiritual Assembly must
be helped to take up the challenges of community development
and of expansion.
In this respect, we call upon you to give special attention to
the advancement of women. In almost all of your region, women
have traditionally played a secondary role in the life of society,
a condition which is still reflected in many Bahá’í communities.
Effective measures have to be adopted to help women take
their rightful place in the teaching and administrative fields. By
teaching entire families, you can ensure that increasing numbers
of women enter the Faith, thereby improving the balance in the
composition of your communities and beginning in each family,
from the moment of acceptance, a process through which the
fundamental principle of the equality between men and women
can be realized.
Of course, your successes in the teaching field and in the
development of local communities will only yield lasting results
if you ensure the proper education of children and youth. Youth
will undoubtedly be the most enthusiastic supporters of the
programs of your institutes. They are eager to make a significant contribution to the progress of their communities and have
shown, time and again, their capacity to respond to the call
to service. They can be trained to help shoulder the manifold
responsibilities demanded by rapid expansion and consolidation. But it is especially important for large numbers of them to
become capable teachers of Bahá’í children’s classes. As you are
well aware, without the education of children it is impossible to
maintain victories from one generation to the next.

All these tasks will require your concentrated attention.
It is important, too, that you maintain the momentum which
the activities of social and economic development have gained,
especially in India. Within their own sphere of competence,
the specialized institutes, the schools and other projects are
each engaged in work critical to the development of human
resources. We hope that those who benefit from such programs
will generously offer their talents to the institutions of the Faith
in furthering the interests of the Four Year Plan.
As you respond to the requirements of the plans soon to
be formulated by your institutions, you must ever bear in mind
that you will contribute to the central aim of the Four Year Plan
only if you teach persistently, prayerfully, lovingly and wisely.
You should endeavor to bring into your ranks individuals from
every stratum of society as you vigorously advance in the process of entry by troops. Receptive souls should be sought among
the affluent and the indigent, in the various circles of urban
society and in schools and universities, in centers of industry
and commerce and in the vast rural areas of your countries.
You should also remember that your exertions are not to be
limited to your own home fronts, but that from among you
must continue to arise an increasing number of souls to serve as
pioneers and traveling teachers in the international field.
In the coming years, enormous spiritual forces will be
acting upon your peoples. You should be confident that your
exertions will have a powerful effect on the course of their
destinies. Let the words of the Guardian written during the first
of the systematic plans to be launched in your region guide your
endeavors: “You should at all times fix your gaze on the promise of Bahá’u’lláh, put your whole trust in His creative Word,
recall the past and manifold evidences of His all-encompassing
and resistless power and arise to become worthy and exemplary
recipients of His all-sustaining grace and blessings.”
May the confirmations of the Blessed Beauty be ceaselessly
showered upon you, and His All-Powerful Spirit inspire and
sustain you throughout the collective enterprise on which you
now embark.

Rid.ván 1996
To the Followers of Bahá’u’lláh in Western and Central Asia
Dearly loved Friends,
12.1

12.2

As a turbulent yet luminous century draws to a close,
the Bahá’í community is embarking on another campaign in
the progressive unfoldment of the Divine Plan. The global
enterprises thus far executed by the consecrated adherents of
His Cause have systematically spread the light of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation to every corner of the earth and have firmly established the institutions of His Administrative Order. The Four
Year Plan, whose primary aim is to effect a significant advance
in the process of entry by troops, is being launched at a time
when the Cause of God has emerged from obscurity, when its
contributions to society are being increasingly acknowledged,
and when humanity’s prolonged and continuous suffering has
created an atmosphere of search for spiritual values and has
raised the level of receptivity to the Cause.
We call upon our much-loved coworkers in the western and
central parts of the Asiatic continent, the home of the oldest
and most venerable Bahá’í communities, to rally round their
divinely ordained institutions and to arise during these years to
demonstrate once again the devotion, valor and determination
which have already conferred matchless distinction upon them.
You have the honor of serving the Faith in a region above whose
horizon the dawn of the Great Day of the Lord appeared, in
whose bosom the infant Cause of God was nurtured, on whose
soil so much sacred blood was shed, on whose western shores
the Qiblih of the people of Bahá is established, within whose
embrace the first Mashriqu’l-Adhkár was raised, and from
which hosts of devoted and committed Bahá’ís have, in the past
decades, set out to bear the banner of the Faith to every part
of the globe.

Our thoughts turn first to the community of Bahá’u’lláh’s
lovers in the land where His Faith was born. Although they are
still denied the freedom to resume direct participation in the
series of campaigns by which the Cause is steadily advancing
throughout the world, their achievements constitute irrefutable proof of the creative power of the daily sacrifices they
are ­making for the vindication of the Faith. What is becoming
apparent, as this new global Plan opens, is that the build-up of
spiritual strength within the Iranian Bahá’í community—­purified
by suffering and steeled by adversity—represents a reservoir of
energy that will, in God’s good time, bring incalculable benefits
to the Cause. “Say: The springs that sustain the life of these
birds are not of this world. Their source is far above the reach
and ken of human apprehension.”
In the lands to the south and west of Iran, Bahá’ís live under restrictions which prevent them from teaching the Cause to
their fellow-countrymen. Yet, by the outstanding contributions
they have made to the progress of the Faith in other parts of
the world, they have proved that their enthusiasm to spread the
Divine Message cannot be dampened. It has been particularly
heartening to witness the eagerness and rapidity with which, as
soon as the barriers to teaching in the republics of Central Asia
and the Caucasus were removed, they rushed to the aid of the
small bands of believers who had persevered there for so many
decades and helped them to build the vibrant communities now
flourishing in these regions today. No doubt they will continue
to lend valuable assistance to the communities in Central Asia
and the Caucasus during the Four Year Plan.
In these republics, through the combined efforts of native
and visiting teachers, extraordinary advances can be expected.
A pattern for the rapid growth of the Cause has already been
established in the region: locality after locality has been opened
to the Faith and, because of the high receptivity of the people,
the number of believers in each place has quickly risen, resulting in the election of a Spiritual Assembly to guide the affairs of
the nascent community. Integral to this pattern, almost from the
very outset, has been the holding of regular institute courses,
which have assisted the friends in becoming strong promoters
of the Cause. If the expansion and consolidation activities
are vigorously pursued according to this same pattern in the
coming years, the growth of the Faith will accelerate, greatly
increasing the number of believers and centers.

To effect such accelerated growth, the friends in these
countries must become so deepened in their understanding of
the Faith as to take up, on their own initiative, the torch of
guidance that will enlighten the multitudes. They should not
be content with small communities, nor allow the tasks of
administering their own community affairs to divert them from
the essential purpose of bringing new members into their ranks.
Each community, from the earliest phases of its development,
should be fired by a vision of the glory of the Cause and imbued
with the zeal to achieve rapid and sustained expansion both in
the locality itself and in the nearby towns and villages.
In Pakistan, where a well-grounded community traces its
roots back some hundred years, the friends must make a mighty
effort to increase their numbers significantly among people of
every walk of life. The will and determination needed to sustain
large-scale expansion and consolidation can be created through
a consistent and widespread institute program aimed at exposing growing contingents of believers to the Creative Word, thus
enhancing their spiritual capacities to diffuse the light of the
Faith and to further the development of its institutions. Such a
rapid process of growth requires that more and more women be
enabled to move to the forefront of Bahá’í activity, in both the
teaching and administrative fields. While rising to the challenge
of entry by troops in their homeland, the friends in Pakistan
need also to pay special attention to their long-suffering Afghan
neighbors, who cry out for the Healing Message of Bahá’u’lláh,
the one true balm for their afflictions.
In all your countries, you must continue to give the highest
priority to the education of children. Having seen the effects
of the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh on generation after generation,
you well understand the value of Bahá’í education and of a
proper spiritual upbringing. In those areas where activities
are restricted, you are nevertheless able to teach the children
of your own communities and help them to grow to become
pillars of strength. In other areas, you have the possibility, nay
the obligation, to open your classes to children of non-Bahá’í
families and to become known as the educators of the coming
generations of your peoples.
Dear Friends, the time is short, and weighty responsibilities
have been placed on the shoulders of each and every Bahá’í. In
His Most Holy Book, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Blessed Beauty
states:

you hold so dear. We shall remember all of you in our prayers
in the Holy Shrines and shall beseech Bahá’u’lláh to guide and

Dearly loved Friends,
13.1
13.2

13.3

13.4

We acclaim with grateful hearts the eager response on all
continents to the Four Year Plan launched last Rid. ván.
Consultations of the Continental Counsellors and National
Spiritual Assemblies started an extensive planning process,
also involving Auxiliary Board members and Local Spiritual
Assemblies. Through such a process the national and regional
character of the derivative plans took shape. But this worldencompassing exercise did more than yield distinctive schemes
for the different countries; it also boosted the collaborative
relationship of the two arms of the Administrative Order, a
most welcome portent of the victories yet to come.
A sign of the immediate impact of the Plan was the speed
with which steps were taken to establish nearly two hundred
training institutes during the last twelve months. Many of
these have gone far beyond the point of designing their organization; they are actually in operation and have offered their
first courses. Moreover, in the movement of homefront and
international pioneers and traveling teachers; in the increased
attention given by individuals to deputizing teachers; in the
preparations made to ensure the formation of Local Spiritual
Assemblies only on the first day of Rid.ván; in the increasing
endeavors to hold regular devotional meetings; in the widening
efforts to make use of the arts in the teaching work and community activities—in all these respects could be discerned the
friends’ keen awareness of the importance of concentrating on
the requirements of the major aim of the Plan, which is to effect
a significant advance in the process of entry by troops.
Nor can we neglect to recognize other developments during
the past year which confirmed the high merit of the manifold
efforts being exerted by our world community and the results
83

being achieved. Among these, to mention a few, were: the
acquisition of the apartment at 4 Avenue de Camoëns in Paris
where the beloved Master, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, resided during His
historic visit to the city; the special session on 14 August of
the Federal Chamber of Deputies in Brazil to mark the 75th
anniversary of the introduction of the Bahá’í Faith into that
country—a unique, official occasion at which Amatu’l-Bahá
Rúh. íyyih Khánum was present as the honored guest; the
launching last July of the Bahá’í International Community’s site
on the World Wide Web, entitled “The Bahá’í World,” which to
date has received from more than 90 countries and territories
over 50,000 visits, averaging some 200 per day.
Hardly outpaced by such accomplishments, the construction
projects on Mount Carmel maintained a dazzling momentum
highlighted by the completion of the marble colonnade of the
Centre for the Study of the Texts, by the rise of the International
Teaching Centre building towards its seventh level, and by the
ongoing emergence of the far-stretching features of the Terraces
of the Shrine of the Báb. In this connection must be mentioned
the partial lowering of the section of the public road over which
the line of terraces will pass, and the acquisition and subsequent
demolition of the building at the foot of the mountain which
stood as the last obstruction that had to be overcome to make
possible the completion of the lower terraces through which
the glorious pathway rises up towards the sacred Edifice and
beyond it to the crest of the Hill of God.
Also of acute relevance to the progress thus described was
the maintenance of a level of contributions to the Arc Projects
Fund which fulfilled the goal for the last year. Clearly, the
financial demands in this regard are being met with incessant
heroism by rich and poor alike, and must be sustained over the
remaining years. At the same time, however, a parallel effort,
equally strenuous and sustained, should be simultaneously
exerted by the Assemblies and friends throughout the world to
fill the critical needs of the Bahá’í International Fund.
Such an auspicious beginning to the Four Year Plan as
has been experienced cannot but inspire confidence in the
hearts of the members of our worldwide community that they
are fully equipped to execute its requirements as outlined in
the messages that launched it, and as ­ elaborated in the plans
adopted by their respective Assemblies. A further and especially
appreciated encouragement as we enter this second year is that

circumstances have made it feasible for the reestablishment this
Rid.ván of the National Spiritual Assembly of Rwanda. This
victory over crisis will bring to 175 the number of National
Spiritual Assemblies that will be eligible to participate in the
Eighth International Bahá’í Convention to be held next Rid.ván
at the Bahá’í World Centre. How dearly we hope that by then,
at the very midpoint of the Plan, the Bahá’í world will have
made a major leap forward in the multiplication of its human
resources, the maturation of its Spiritual Assemblies, and the
evolution of its local communities!
The opportunity offered by the brief span of time before
the century ends is precious beyond all telling. Only a united
and sustained effort by the friends everywhere to advance the
process of entry by troops can befit such a historic moment.
Responsibilities urgent and inescapable press upon every
institution, every member of a community striving towards its
God-promised destiny. As there is only a short period in which
to achieve a great deal, no time must be spared, no opportunity
lost. Rest assured, dear friends, that the hosts of the Abhá
Kingdom stand ready to rush to the support of anyone who will
arise to offer his or her acts of service to the unfolding, spiritual
drama of these momentous days.

To National Spiritual Assemblies
Dear Bahá’í Friends,
14.1

14.2

14.3

The expansion of the Bahá’í community and the growing
complexity of the issues which are facing National Spiritual
Assemblies in certain countries have brought the Cause to a
new stage in its development. They have caused us in recent
years to examine various aspects of the balance between
centralization and decentralization. In a few countries we have
authorized the National Spiritual Assemblies to establish State
Bahá’í Councils or Regional Teaching and Administrative
Committees. From the experience gained in the operation of
these bodies, and from detailed examination of the principles
set forth by Shoghi Effendi, we have reached the conclusion
that the time has arrived for us to formalize a new element of
Bahá’í administration, between the local and national levels,
comprising institutions of a special kind, to be designated as
“Regional Bahá’í Councils.”
Regional Bahá’í Councils will be brought into being only
with our permission and only in countries where conditions
make this step necessary. Nevertheless, we find it desirable to
inform all National Spiritual Assemblies of the nature of this
historic development, and to make clear its place in the evolution of national and local Bahá’í institutions.
The institutions of the Administrative Order of Bahá’u’lláh,
rooted in the provisions of His Revelation, have emerged
gradually and organically, as the Bahá’í community has grown
through the power of the divine impulse imparted to humankind
in this age. The characteristics and functions of each of these
institutions have evolved, and are still evolving, as are the relationships between them. The writings of the beloved Guardian
expound the fundamental elements of this mighty System and
make it clear that the Administrative Order, although different
87

14.1

14.2

14.3

Turning Point

14.4

14.5

14.6
14.7

in many ways from the World Order which it is the destiny of
the Bahá’í Revelation to call into being, is both the “nucleus”
and “pattern” of that World Order. Thus, the evolution of the
institutions of the Administrative Order, while following many
variants to meet changing conditions in different times and
places, should strictly follow the essential principles of Bahá’í
administration which have been laid down in the Sacred Text
and in the interpretations provided by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the
Guardian.
One of the subtle qualities of the Bahá’í Administrative
Order is the balance between centralization and decentralization. This balance must be correctly maintained, but different
factors enter into the equation, depending upon the institutions
involved. For example, the relationship between a National
or Local Spiritual Assembly and its committees is of a different nature from that between National and Local Spiritual
Assemblies. The former is a relationship between a central
administrative body and “its assisting organs of executive and
legislative action,”† while the latter is a relationship between
national and local levels of the House of Justice, each of which
is a divinely ordained institution with clearly prescribed jurisdiction, duties and prerogatives.
Regional Bahá’í Councils partake of some, but not all,
characteristics of Spiritual Assemblies, and thus provide a means
of carrying forward the teaching work and administering related
affairs of a rapidly growing Bahá’í community in a number of
situations. Without such an institution, the development of a national committee structure required to cover the needs in some
countries would run the danger of over-complexity through adding a further layer of committees under the regional committees,
or the danger of excessive decentralization through conferring
too much autonomy on committees which are characterized by
the Guardian as “bodies that should be regarded in no other
light than that of expert advisers and executive assistants.”
The distinguishing effects of the establishment of Regional
Bahá’í Councils are the following:


It provides for a level of autonomous decision making on
both teaching and administrative matters, as distinct from

merely executive action, below the National Assembly and
above the Local Assemblies.
14.8



It involves the members of Local Spiritual Assemblies of the
area in the choice of the members of the Council, thus reinforcing the bond between it and the local believers while, at
the same time, bringing into public service capable believers
who are known to the friends in their own region.

14.8

14.9



It establishes direct consultative relationships between
the Continental Counsellors and the Regional Bahá’í
Councils.

14.9

14.10



It offers the possibility of forming a Regional Bahá’í
Council in an ethnically distinct region which covers parts
of two or more countries. In such a situation the Council
is designated to work directly under one of the National
Assemblies involved, providing copies of its reports and
minutes to the other National Assembly.

14.10

14.11



The greater degree of decentralization involved in the
devolution of authority upon Regional Bahá’í Councils
requires a corresponding increase in the capacity of the
National Spiritual Assembly itself to keep fully informed of
what is proceeding in all parts of the territory over which it
has ultimate jurisdiction.

14.11

14.12

For those National Spiritual Assemblies which have already
established Regional Bahá’í Councils or Regional Teaching
and Administrative Committees, we enclose a document which
outlines the various policies governing the formation and functioning of Regional Bahá’í Councils. For the sake of simplicity,
we have used the designation “Regional Bahá’í Councils”
throughout, but the actual name used will, as heretofore, vary
from country to country, including such names as “State Bahá’í
Councils,” “Provincial Bahá’í Councils” or, when referring
to an individual Council, “The Bahá’í Council for . . . ,” etc.
To avoid the confusion of thought which seems to have been
caused by referring to “Regional Teaching and Administrative
Committees,” we have decided to cease using this designation
and to refer to these bodies as Bahá’í Councils formed by
appointment rather than election. We shall be writing separately to these National Spiritual Assemblies, indicating what
modifications, if any, they should now make to the existing
structures.

and size of the Bahá’í community indicate that
such a development would be beneficial. In
such cases, all other parts of the country remain
under the well-established pattern of national
committees, including a national teaching committee and its regional teaching committees.
2.1.2 The number of members of a Regional Bahá’í
Council is nine or, in certain cases, seven or
even five, depending upon the decision of the
National Spiritual Assembly in each case.
2.1.3 In accordance with local requirements and
the condition of the Bahá’í community, the
Universal House of Justice will decide which
Regional Bahá’í Councils are to be formed by
election and which by appointment.
2.1.4 It is within the discretion of the National
Spiritual Assembly to decide, case by case,
whether its members may also serve on
91

14.16

Turning Point

14.17

Regional Bahá’í Councils. In general the pre­
ference is for members of National Assemblies
not to serve on Councils, whether these be
elected or appointed bodies.
2.2 Regional Bahá’í Councils formed by election:
2.2.1 The members of an elected Regional Bahá’í
Council, who shall be nine in number, are
elected from among all the adult believers in the
region by the members of the Local Spiritual
Assemblies in that region every year on 23 May,
the anniversary of the Declaration of the Báb
according to the Gregorian calendar, or on a
weekend immediately before or after that date.†
2.2.2 Owing to the large number of voters involved
and the brief interval between the National
Convention and the elections of the Regional
Bahá’í Councils, these elections are to be conducted primarily by mail, through methods to
be decided by the National Spiritual Assembly.
The voting is to be by secret ballot. The
members of the Local Spiritual Assemblies may
send in their ballots individually or they may be
collected by the Secretary of the Local Spiritual
Assembly and mailed together.
2.2.3 If feasible and desirable, an electoral meeting,
or several electoral meetings, may be held in the
region for those voters able to attend, in order
to provide an occasion for members of Local
Spiritual Assemblies in the region to consult
about the progress of the Cause. Other believers may attend, but would not take part in the
voting.
† A letter dated 12 March 2000 to all National Spiritual Assemblies
written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice explained: “In
view of the experience gained over a period of several years, the
House of Justice has recognized that it would be more practical to
set a new date for the formation of these institutions. Henceforth,
then, the election or appointment of Regional Councils will take
effect every year on 26 November, the Day of the Covenant. The
formation processes will, of course, have to be set in motion in
sufficient time to be concluded on this date.”

2.3.2 Balloting takes place among members of Local
Spiritual Assemblies in the region, similarly
to that for the election of a Regional Bahá’í

3. The Functions of Regional Bahá’í Councils:
14.19

14.20

The functions of a Regional Bahá’í Council and the degree
of authority conferred upon it are within the discretion of
a National Spiritual Assembly. However, they should not be
limited to those of a national or regional committee for, in
such a case, there would be no justification for bringing into
being a Regional Bahá’í Council rather than appointing a
national or regional committee. The functions and responsibilities generally envisaged for a Regional Bahá’í Council
are as follows:
3.1 To carry out the policies of the National Spiritual
Assembly and to supervise, on behalf of the National
Assembly, the smooth and efficient execution of the
plans and projects for its region.
93

14.19

14.20

Turning Point
14.21

14.22

14.23

3.2 To keep the National Spiritual Assembly regularly informed of the Council’s activities and of the conditions
of the Faith throughout the region. Regional Bahá’í
Councils are allowed to develop their own strategies
and programs, and to carry out their day-to-day work
without having to obtain further approval from the
National Spiritual Assembly. However, through their
frequent reports and the minutes of their meetings, the
National Assembly is kept informed of their activities
and maintains its overall supervision of the affairs of
the Cause in all parts of the country.
3.3 To take initiative in the promotion of the Faith in the
region and to carry out its decisions within the range
of authority vested in it by the National Assembly.
The National Assembly allows the Council a wide
latitude for autonomous action, intervening in its work
only in matters which the Assembly regards as being
of major importance. The main task of a Regional
Bahá’í Council is to devise and execute expansion and
consolidation plans in close collaboration with the Local
Spiritual Assemblies and the believers within its area of
jurisdiction. Its goal is to create strong Local Spiritual
Assemblies which will be the focal centers of Bahá’í
activity, will exercise their vitally important role in the
development of the Faith and will demonstrate their ability to regulate the affairs of their local communities.
3.4 To deal with both teaching and administrative matters
within the region including the appointment of committees for issues within its terms of reference, such as
external affairs and the translation, publication and
distribution of Bahá’í literature.
3.4.1 In the area of teaching, a Regional Bahá’í
Council may be given authority by the National
Assembly to appoint, direct and supervise the
work of a number of area or district teaching
committees. In those cases where a Regional
Bahá’í Council has to carry out a wide range
of functions, it may also be authorized by
the National Spiritual Assembly to appoint a
regional teaching committee to be responsible
to it for the teaching work in the region as a

whole and for the direction and supervision of
the area or district teaching committees.
3.4.2 A Regional Bahá’í Council may be asked by
the National Spiritual Assembly to arrange and
supervise the unit elections for delegates to the
national convention.
3.4.3 The working relationship between the Local
Spiritual Assemblies and the National Spiritual
Assembly in an area where there is a Regional
Bahá’í Council will depend upon the range of
functions and responsibilities conferred by the
National Assembly upon the Council. In any
case the authority to deprive a believer of his
or her administrative rights, or to restore them,
remains with the National Assembly. The right
of direct access to the National Assembly by a
Local Spiritual Assembly is preserved.
To be responsible, under the general guidelines and
policies established by the National Spiritual Assembly,
for conducting, on behalf of the National Assembly, the
external affairs of the Faith at the level of the region,
representing the Bahá’ís of the region in relation to the
civil authorities of that region.
To take part, under the guidance of the National
Spiritual Assembly and in consultation with the
Counsellors or their deputies, in the formulation of a
plan for its region as part of the national plan within
the framework of each worldwide Plan.
To devise, for the approval of the National Assembly,
its own expansion and consolidation programs for
the achievement of the plan for its region, within the
overall framework of the national plan.
To formulate an annual budget for the region, in consultation with the Counsellors or their deputies when
advisable, and to submit this budget to the National
Spiritual Assembly for its approval.
3.8.1 Alternatively, should the conditions indicate
the advisability of such a method, the annual
budgets of Regional Bahá’í Councils may be
specified by the National Spiritual Assembly.

3.9 To administer the budget for the region, sending
regular reports and financial statements to the National
Spiritual Assembly.
3.10 A Regional Bahá’í Council can be authorized by the
National Spiritual Assembly to act as its agent in operating a regional branch of the national Bahá’í fund.
In this respect the Council may perform the following
functions.
3.10.1 It encourages believers within its region to contribute to various funds of the Cause, including
the regional branch of the national fund, with
the aim that, in due course, the entire expenditure for the region would be provided by the
believers in the region.
3.10.2 If the whole of the budgeted expenditure for a
year cannot be met by contributions from the
believers in the region, the Council may apply
to the National Spiritual Assembly for an allocation from the national Bahá’í fund.
3.10.3 It is also within the discretion of the Counsellors
to allocate financial assistance to a Regional
Bahá’í Council from the funds at their
disposition.
3.11 Under normal conditions, correspondence between
Regional Bahá’í Councils and the Bahá’í World Centre
should be addressed to the National Spiritual Assembly,
which would then convey the communication to its
intended recipient.
3.11.1 If, because of local conditions, the Universal
House of Justice authorizes certain Regional
Bahá’í Councils to correspond directly with
it, copies of all such correspondence should be
sent to the National Assembly.
3.11.2 Copies of the Bahá’í International News Service
and of certain circular letters may be mailed
from the Bahá’í World Centre directly to all
Regional Bahá’í Councils.
3.11.3 When Regional Bahá’í Councils publish Bahá’í
literature or regional newsletters, copies of
such publications should be sent directly to the
96

14.28

14.29

14.30

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

14.31

14.32

Bahá’í World Centre under the same guidelines
as apply to national Bahá’í publications.
3.11.4 Although, in general, Regional Bahá’í Councils
can be authorized to correspond directly with
the World Centre in order to share current information about the activities of their respective
communities, this should not be misconstrued
as a means to bypass the institution of the
National Spiritual Assembly in matters requiring guidance or decision.
3.12 In most countries the legal status of Regional Bahá’í
Councils would seem to be adequately covered by the
National Assembly’s incorporation.
3.13 Just as Counsellors have direct consultative relations
with National and Local Spiritual Assemblies, so
they also have direct relations with Regional Bahá’í
Councils.
3.13.1 Whenever the Counsellors feel it necessary or
desirable, they are free to deputize one or more
Auxiliary Board members to represent them in
consultations with a Regional Bahá’í Council.
Also, occasional meetings should be arranged
between a Regional Bahá’í Council and the
Auxiliary Board members responsible for areas
within its region, for the discussion of the vision and strategies for the work. A regular and
free exchange of information between Auxiliary
Board members on the one hand and Regional
Bahá’í Councils on the other is encouraged.

4. National Committees in the New Structure:
14.33

14.34

It is advisable for a National Spiritual Assembly to have
a National Teaching Committee even if Regional Bahá’í
Councils are formed in every part of a country. The functions of the National Teaching Committee in a country in
which Regional Bahá’í Councils have been established are
as follows.
4.1 The Guardian has referred to national committees as
expert advisers and executive assistants of a National
Spiritual Assembly. This suggests that, rather than diminishing the role of its National Teaching Committee
97

14.33

14.34

Turning Point

14.35

14.36

when Regional Bahá’í Councils are formed, a National
Spiritual Assembly would develop further the advisory and executive aspects of its responsibilities in
certain respects. The capacity of the National Teaching
Committee to monitor the effectiveness of the teaching
work throughout the country could be enhanced.
Through its knowledge of the progress of the work,
it should be able to bring to the National Assembly’s
attention strengths and needs in any region. There are
also a number of specific matters, such as the analysis
of opportunities for expansion and consolidation in
rapidly changing conditions, the identification of successful approaches to teaching, and the dissemination
of promising teaching methods, which would benefit
from the constant attention of a vibrant and competent
National Teaching Committee. Issues related to teaching among minorities and specific groups who reside in
more than one region of the country present another
area which would benefit from a National Teaching
Committee’s attention.
4.2 The work of the National Teaching Committee in relation to Regional Bahá’í Councils is one of service and
assistance, rather than direction and supervision as it is
in relation to regional teaching committees. A parallel
can be seen in the work of a national training institute,
to which the National Assembly assigns the task of
developing human resources: the institute assists the
Councils by offering them programs for the training of
the human resources needed to carry out their plans in
each region. The National Teaching Committee would,
similarly, offer services to the Councils in support of
the teaching work.
4.3 In countries where Regional Bahá’í Councils have
been introduced only for certain areas, the National
Teaching Committee is expected to perform not
only the functions outlined above, but also to remain
responsible, both directly and through its Regional
Teaching Committees, for serving those areas not
under the care of a Council. In carrying out such
functions there must, of course, be close collaboration
between the National Teaching Committee and its

98

14.35

14.36

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

14.37

Regional Teaching Committees on the one hand, and
the Regional Bahá’í Councils on the other.
4.4 In the case of all national committees, it is important
to ensure that legitimate national programs do not run
counter to the process of decentralization, except in
special emergency situations.

To the Friends Gathered at the Latin American
Youth Congress in Chile
Dear Friends,
15.1

15.2

15.3

As the Cause of God advances resistlessly along the path
traced out for it by its Divine Founder, each stage of the process
opens up to a new generation of Bahá’í youth challenges unique
to the historical moment. Building on the accomplishments
of the generations before, youth must devise ways to take
advantage of the opportunities presented to them. A discourse
in consonance with the requirements of the time has to be
refined, and activities aimed at transforming society have to be
pursued with vigor.
To accomplish such tasks during the brief span of time
afforded youth requires resolve, spiritual discipline, energy, reliance on the power of divine assistance, and constant immersion
in the Word of God. These efforts, which constitute an integral
part of the growth processes of the Bahá’í community itself,
nevertheless possess characteristics distinctly their own. In
recent years, and in many parts of the world, Bahá’í Youth have
referred to their collective endeavors as a “youth movement,”
a reminder that the energy being generated will not only bring
new recruits from among their peers, but will move an entire
generation one step closer to the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh.
Over the next few days you will be contemplating the
special opportunities which the Hand of Providence has laid
before you. An essential component of any strategy you devise
is training. In all your countries, this question is being enthusiastically addressed as institutes learn to operate with increasing
effectiveness. You yourselves are participating, as students and
as teachers, in building capacity in your communities to train
thousands and thousands of believers, many of whom will
be young people. With this vision in mind, you should devise

actions, characteristic of your youth movement, in which your
swelling numbers will engage. How will you teach the Cause
and advance the process of entry by troops? How will you
contribute to the establishment of a distinctly Bahá’í life? And
how will you accelerate the transformation of Latin American
society to achieve its high destiny? As you contemplate these
questions, be assured that our prayers will surround you.

Rid.ván 1998
To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
16.1

16.2

16.3

At this halfway mark in the Four Year Plan, we affirm
with uplifted hearts that the worldwide Bahá’í community is
breaking new ground at a dynamic stage in its evolution. The
process of entry by troops, upon which its energies are focused,
is clearly advancing.
Three developments brighten our expectations. One is in
the solid results being produced wherever training institutes
are in operation. Tens of thousands of individuals have over
the last two years completed at least one institute course. The
immediate effects upon them have been a greatly strengthened
faith, a more conscious spiritual identity, and a deepened commitment to Bahá’í service. The second pertains to the notable
improvement in the conditions affecting the establishment and
renewal of Local Spiritual Assemblies. The decision to form
these institutions only on the first day of Rid.ván, and to do so
principally at the initiative of the communities to which they
belong, was put into effect in 1997. While there was an immediate but not unexpected drop in the number of Local Assemblies
worldwide, the decrease was not very large; in fact, increases
were recorded in some countries. This outcome indicates that
the process of maturation of these divinely ordained institutions
is on course. The third is that a new confidence in teaching
is stirring the friends, yielding impressive results in various
regions. The potential for a steady and ever-expanding influx
of new believers has always been great, and we are able to say
with assurance that the capacity to actualize it is methodically
being developed more than ever before with the prosecution of
the current Plan.
Further to these signs of progress, we are gratified by the
marvelous speed with which the construction projects on Mount
103

16.1

16.2

16.3

Turning Point

16.4

16.5

Carmel proceeded to fulfill the schedule which had been set for
the year just ended. Immediately ahead are the ­establishment
in May of three new National Spiritual Assemblies—Sabah,
Sarawak, and Slovakia—and the reestablishment of the
National Spiritual Assembly in Liberia, raising to 179 the
pillars of the Universal House of Justice. In contemplating the
divine favors being bestowed on our community, we acknowledge with deep gratitude the constancy of the acts of service
being performed by the individual Hands of the Cause of God,
by the International Teaching Centre, and by the Counsellors
and their auxiliaries on all continents. The increasing strength
of National Spiritual Assemblies also bolsters our certitude in
the imminence of resounding victories.
Against this salutary picture of the community’s prospects
is the confused background of a planet at odds with itself. And
yet, amid the widespread desolation of the human spirit, it is
apparent that at some level of consciousness there is among
the peoples of the world a growing sense of an irresistible
movement towards global unity and peace. This sense is being
aroused as the physical barriers between peoples are being
virtually eliminated by breathtaking advances in science and
technology. Nevertheless, a mixed catalogue of world-shaking
tribulations and world-shaping developments keeps humanity
concurrently dazed and dazzled. The storms and stresses battering the social fabric are incomprehensible to all except the
relatively few of the planet’s inhabitants who recognize God’s
purpose for this Day.
Our fellow human beings everywhere are insensibly
subjected at one and the same time to the conflicting emotions
incited by the continuous operation of simultaneous processes
of “rise and of fall, of integration and of disintegration, of
order and chaos.” These Shoghi Effendi identified as aspects
of the Major Plan and Minor Plan of God, the two known
ways in which His purpose for humankind is going forward.
The Major Plan is associated with turbulence and calamity and
proceeds with an apparent, random disorderliness, but is, in
fact, inexorably driving humanity towards unity and maturity.
Its agency for the most part is the people who are ignorant of its
course and even antagonistic towards its aim. As Shoghi Effendi
has pointed out, God’s Major Plan uses “both the mighty and
the lowly as pawns in His world-shaping game, for the fulfillment of His immediate purpose and the eventual establishment
104

16.4

16.5

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

16.6

16.7

16.8

16.9

of His Kingdom on earth.” The acceleration of the processes
it generates is lending impetus to developments which, with all
the initial pain and heartache attributable to them, we Bahá’ís
see as signs of the emergence of the Lesser Peace.
Unlike His Major Plan, which works mysteriously, God’s
Minor Plan is clearly delineated, operates according to orderly
and well-known processes, and has been given to us to execute.
Its ultimate goal is the Most Great Peace. The four-year-long
campaign, at the mid-point of which we have arrived, constitutes
the current stage in the Minor Plan. It is to the achievement of
its purpose that we must all devote our attention and energies.
At times it may seem that the operation of the Major Plan
causes a disruption in the work of the Minor Plan, but the
friends have every reason to remain undismayed. For they recognize the source of the recurrent turbulence at play in the world
and, in the words of our Guardian, “acknowledge its necessity,
observe confidently its mysterious processes, ardently pray for
the mitigation of its severity, intelligently labor to assuage its
fury, and anticipate, with undimmed vision, the consummation
of the fears and the hopes it must necessarily engender.”
Even a cursory survey of the global scene in recent years
cannot but lead to observations fraught with special significance for a Bahá’í viewer. For one thing, amid the din of a
society in turmoil can be discerned an unmistakable trend
towards the Lesser Peace. An intriguing inkling is provided
by the greater involvement of the United Nations, with the
backing of powerful governments, in attending to long-standing and urgent world problems; another derives from the
dramatic recognition by world leaders in only recent months
of what the interconnectedness of all nations in the matter of
trade and finance really implies—a condition which Shoghi
Effendi anticipated as an essential aspect of an organically
unified world. But a development of even greater moment
to the Bahá’í community is that a massive number of people
are searching for spiritual truth. Several recently published
studies have been devoted to this phenomenon. The ideologies that dominated the larger part of this century have been
exhausted; at their waning in the century’s closing years, a
hunger for meaning, a yearning of the soul, is on the rise.
This spiritual hunger is characterized by a restlessness, by
a swelling dissatisfaction with the moral state of society; it is
also evident in the upsurge of fundamentalism among various
105

16.6

16.7

16.8

16.9

Turning Point

16.10

16.12

religious sects, and in the multiplication of new movements
posing as religions or aspiring to take the place of religion. Here
are observations that enable one to appreciate the interaction
between the two divinely propelled processes at work on the
planet. The manifold opportunities thus providentially provided
to present the Message of Bahá’u’lláh to searching souls create
a dynamic situation for the Bahá’í teacher. The implications for
the task at hand are immensely encouraging.
Our hopes, our goals, our possibilities of moving forward
can all be realized through concentrating our endeavors on the
major aim of the Divine Plan at its current stage—that is, to
effect a significant advance in the process of entry by troops.
This challenge can be met through persistent effort patiently
pursued. Entry by troops is a possibility well within the grasp
of our community. Unremitting faith, prayer, the promptings of
the soul, Divine assistance—these are among the essentials of
progress in any Bahá’í undertaking. But also of vital importance
to bringing about entry by troops is a realistic approach, systematic action. There are no shortcuts. Systematization ensures
consistency of lines of action based on well-conceived plans. In
a general sense, it implies an orderliness of approach in all that
pertains to Bahá’í service, whether in teaching or administration, in individual or collective endeavor. While allowing for
individual initiative and spontaneity, it suggests the need to
be clear-headed, methodical, efficient, constant, balanced and
harmonious. Systematization is a necessary mode of functioning
animated by the urgency to act.
Towards ensuring an orderly evolution of the community,
a function of Bahá’í institutions is to organize and maintain a
process of developing human resources whereby Bahá’ís, new
and veteran alike, can acquire the knowledge and capacity
to sustain a continuous expansion and consolidation of the
community. The establishment of training institutes is critical
to such effort, since they are centers through which large
numbers of individuals can acquire and improve their ability
to teach and administer the Faith. Their existence underscores
the importance of knowledge of the Faith as a source of power
for invigorating the life of the Bahá’í community and of the
individuals who compose it.
The facts at hand confirm that the Four Year Plan works
where a systematic approach is understood and applied. These
same facts show that the institutions of the Faith, in their
106

16.10

16.11

16.12

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

16.13

16.14

16.15

16.16

­collaborative efforts at national, regional, and local levels, have
clearly been adhering to this understanding. However, with
individuals, on whom rests the ultimate success of the Plan, this
understanding is less clear. For this reason, we must emphasize
to our fellow-believers the importance to their individual
effort of this prerequisite of success in teaching and in other
undertakings.
As translated into programs and projects by national and
local institutions, the Plan, among other things, gives direction, identifies goals, stimulates effort, provides a variety of
needed facilities and materials to benefit the work of teachers
and administrators. This is of course necessary for the proper
functioning of the community, but is of no consequence unless
its individual members respond through active participation.
In so responding, each individual, too, must make a conscious
decision as to what he or she will do to serve the Plan, and as to
how, where and when to do it. This determination enables the
individual to check the progress of his actions and, if necessary,
to modify the steps being taken. Becoming accustomed to such
a procedure of systematic striving lends meaning and fulfillment
to the life of any Bahá’í.
But beyond the necessity of responding to the call of the
institutions, the individual is charged by Bahá’u’lláh Himself
with the sacred duty of teaching His Cause, described by Him
as the “most meritorious of all deeds.”
So long as there are souls in need of enlightenment, this
duty must surely remain the constant occupation of every
believer. In its fulfillment, the individual is directly responsible
to Bahá’u’lláh. “Let him not wait for any directions,” Shoghi
Effendi urgently advises, “or expect any special encouragement,
from the elected representatives of his community, nor be
deterred by any obstacles which his relatives, or fellow-citizens
may be inclined to place in his path, nor mind the censure of his
critics or enemies.” The writings of the Central Figures and of
our Guardian are replete with advice and exhortations concerning the individual’s irreplaceable role in the advancement of the
Cause. So it is inevitable that we should feel impelled, at this
particular time in the life of humanity as a whole, to appeal
directly to each member of our community to ponder the urgent
situation facing us all as the helpers of the Abhá Beauty.
Our lot, dear brothers and sisters, is to be consciously
involved in a vast historic process the like of which has not ever
107

16.13

16.16

before been experienced by any people. As a global ­community,
we have, thus far, attained a unique and magnificent success in
being representative of the full spectrum of the human race—
thanks to the inestimable expenditure of life, effort and treasure
willingly made by thousands of our spiritual forebears. There is
no other aggregation of human beings who can claim to have
raised up a system with the demonstrated capacity to unite all
of God’s children in one world-embracing Order. This achievement places us not only in a position of incomparable strength,
but more particularly in one of inescapable responsibility. Does
not every one of us therefore have a divine obligation to fulfill,
a sacred duty to perform towards every other one who is not
yet aware of the call of God’s latest Manifestation? Time does
not stop, does not wait. With every passing hour a fresh affliction strikes at a distracted humanity. Dare we linger?
In a mere two years the Four Year Plan will be concluded,
just some months before the end of an unforgettable century.
Looming before us, then, is a twofold date with destiny. In extolling the unprecedented potential of the twentieth century, the
beloved Master averred that its traces will last forever. Seized
with such a vision, the mind of the alert follower of the Blessed
Beauty must undoubtedly be astir with anxious questions as to
what part he or she will play in these few fleeting years, and
as to whether he or she will, at the end of this seminal period,
have made a mark among those enduring traces which the mind
of the Master perceived. To ensure a soul-satisfying answer,
one thing above all else is necessary: to act, to act now, and to
continue to act.
Our heartfelt plea at the Holy Threshold on behalf of us
all is that we may be divinely aided and richly confirmed in
whatever we do towards meeting the urgent aim of the Divine
Plan at so fate-laden a moment in human history.

came together here at the outset of your current term of service.
In our message to your conference at that time, we described in
detail not only the purpose and structure of the Four Year Plan
but the form in which it would have to be pursued if it was to
realize its ambitious aim. You were then given the mandate to
go forth and prepare the Bahá’í world to take on the challenges
that lay ahead.
The extraordinary events of the Convention we have all just
witnessed bear eloquent testimony to the ardor and effectiveness of your response. All of the institutions of the Faith have
most certainly played their parts in moving our beloved Cause
a giant step forward in this brief period. The clarity and vigor
with which the National Spiritual Assemblies are addressing the
tasks of the Plan reflect that dramatic advance in maturity that
the Guardian encouraged us to expect in these closing years of
the century. We feel compelled, however, to pay special tribute
to the selfless, inspiriting and intelligent contributions which you
have made to this collective enterprise. Your work has brought
honor to your institution and immense joy to our hearts.
As a result of your unceasing activity during the months immediately following the conference, the Bahá’í world had been
made ready, by the time it received our Rid.ván 1996 message,
to enter into intensive detailed planning. And once national
plans were formulated your efforts did not slacken; with equal
vigor you and your auxiliaries galvanized the believers into
systematic action and helped them to remain focused on the
central aim of the Plan. We hope that you will convey to your
Auxiliary Board members and their assistants our heartfelt
gratitude.

The challenge which now faces the Bahá’í world is to take
advantage of the momentum thus achieved. It has within its
grasp the opportunity to multiply its human resources on a
scale far beyond anything heretofore attained. Every measure
must be taken to ensure that this possibility becomes a reality.
Training must be offered widely, to contingents of newly enrolled and veteran believers alike. It is also imperative that the
energies being generated and the skills being developed through
training institute programs be channeled to serve directly the
needs of the Plan. In short—without any delay—the work
should move to the higher tempo that recent accomplishments
make possible.
Your consultations this week need to be eminently practical. You come to them with a wealth of experience that the
Bahá’í community has never before enjoyed. You are well
aware of the diverse strengths of the communities you serve
and of the efficacy of the methods being employed in the field.
The lessons of these past two years need to be examined and
correlated, and their implications for advancing the process
of entry by troops must be understood. In this context, you
will also have to consider the increased capacity of your own
institution, the work of the Auxiliary Board members, and your
interaction with them, with Spiritual Assemblies, and with the
International Teaching Centre, whose concern it is to reinforce
your efforts with advice, perspectives and resources.
Dear friends! You represent an army of able and highly
motivated servants of the Cause throughout the world. Yours is
an institution which, in one respect, has a particularly intimate
relationship with the Universal House of Justice; in another, it is
able to exercise an influence that penetrates the very grassroots
of the community. Its nature fits it, uniquely, to serve as a river
of encouragement, example and love whose waters can refresh
and invigorate the spirit of every believer they touch.
We will follow your consultations this week with the
heightened hope and confidence which your impressive achievements to date have awakened. For your part, be sure of our
ardent prayers that Bahá’u’lláh will bless your deliberations and
confirm your efforts to help bring about the massive increase in
resources which the mission of our beloved Cause so urgently
requires.

To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
18.1

18.2

Our hearts are aglow with hope as we survey what has
been accomplished in the year preceding the fateful, final
stretch toward the consummation of the Four Year Plan. From
the year’s momentous beginning with the Eighth International
Bahá’í Convention, the Bahá’í world has sustained a rising pace
of activity that has significantly advanced the process of entry
by troops. Our community has grown appreciably, its human
resources have been richly enhanced. From projects of expansion to endeavors at consolidation, from social and economic
development to external affairs, from services of the youth to
expressions in the arts, from the World Centre of the Faith to
remote villages and towns—in fact, from whatever angle the
community is viewed—progress has been made. The prospects
for the Plan are impelling.
The momentum generated at the International Convention
pervaded the Counsellors’ Conference that immediately followed it, further galvanizing the indefatigable participants;
and it charged the proceedings of the National Conventions
held in May, including those of Sabah, Sarawak, and Slovakia
which met for the first time to form their National Spiritual
Assemblies. That same energy infused the International
Teaching Centre, which has been displaying a remarkable
potency in the short time since its sixth term began on the
anniversary of the Declaration of the Báb. Concentrating on
refining and consolidating their organization, the Counsellor
members have refrained from their usual travels during this first
year, but they can be expected after this to resume their visits
to various parts of the world, so as to reinforce their vitalizing
influence on the successful conclusion of the Four Year Plan.

Further to these happenings in the Holy Land, the construction projects on Mount Carmel, beheld with such thrilling
astonishment by the delegates to the International Convention,
press onward towards their scheduled completion at the end of
the century. With the opening since last Rid.ván of all remaining
areas of construction, the speed of work has reached a new
peak. The Centre for the Study of the Texts and the Extension
to the Archives Building are being readied for occupancy within
a few weeks; the exterior of the International Teaching Centre
building is fully clad in marble, while finishing work at all
levels of its interior is proceeding. The lowering of Hatzionut
Avenue, to accommodate the bridge which now connects the
Terraces of the Shrine of the Báb on both sides of the road,
has been completed and normal traffic restored. The unfolding
magnificence of the Terraces has so captured public attention
that the nineteenth terrace at the top of the mountain has
already been opened to visitors on a daily schedule, evoking
the enthusiastic response of a grateful populace. As part of
a campaign to attract international attention to the city, the
Municipality of Haifa has published a pictorial brochure on
the Shrine of the Báb and the Terraces, available in five major
languages besides Hebrew.
We feel compelled to mention at least two other developments at the World Centre of a wholly different order: First,
the decision to raise the number of pilgrims in each group to
150 from 100—this to take effect when the revamping, now in
progress, of the newly acquired building, situated across the
way from the resting place of the Greatest Holy Leaf, has been
completed and use can be made of its provision of a pilgrim
hall and other facilities for the administration of an expanded
pilgrimage program. Second is the notable headway being
made, despite the inevitable slowness of the process, in the plan
to translate texts from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh with a view
to publishing a new English volume of His works. Effort is being devoted to providing full versions of such major Tablets as
the Súriy-i-Mulúk and the Súriy-i-Haykal, as well as complete
texts of Tablets addressed to individual kings and rulers. Also
scheduled for inclusion are the Súriy-i-Ra’ís, the Lawh.-i-Ra’ís
and the Lawh.-i-Fu’ád.
The Cause of Bahá’u’lláh marches on resistlessly, quickened
by the increasing application of an approach to the development and use of human resources that is systematic. The
112

18.3

18.4

18.5

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

18.6

18.7

further creation of national and regional training institutes,
now numbering 344, has pressed this development forward,
with the result that, apart from North America and Iran where
numerous courses have been given, some 70,000 individuals
have already completed at least one institute course. All of this
is contributing to a growing body of confirmed, active supporters of the Cause. The untold potential of this progression
is illustrated in such reports as the one received from Chad,
where in an area served by an institute more than 1,000 people
embraced the Faith through the individual efforts of those
who had received training. Understanding of the necessity
for systematization in the development of human resources is
everywhere taking hold.
Collateral with the demonstrated efficacy of training
institutes is the pragmatic emergence of Regional Bahá’í
Councils in selected countries where conditions have made the
establishment of these institutions necessary and viable. Where
there is close interaction between a Council and a training
institute, the stage is set for a galvanic coherence of the processes effecting expansion and consolidation in a region, and
for the practical matching of the training services of institutes
to the developmental needs of local communities. Moreover, the
operational guidelines whereby the Continental Counsellors and
the Regional Councils have direct access to each other give rise
to a further institutional relationship which, along with that
connecting the Councils to the National and Local Spiritual
Assemblies, effectuates a dynamic integration of functions at
the regional level.
The ever-expanding work in social and economic development is also benefiting from the operation of those training
institutes that give attention to such subjects as literacy,
primary health care and the advancement of women. The
more widespread efforts of the Office of Social and Economic
Development to promote a global process of learning about
relevant Bahá’í principles are enhanced by the work of these
institutes, as well as by the rise of Bahá’í-inspired organizations
scattered throughout the planet. Clearly, then, the institutional
capacity to administer development programs is gaining in
strength. This is apparent in projects sponsored by Bahá’í
institutions or initiated by individuals through the inspiration
of the Faith. An outstanding example of the latter is Unity
College, which was created by a family in Ethiopia as the first,
113

18.6

18.7

Turning Point

18.8

18.9

and since late 1998, the only private college in the country,
with a student body that swelled to 5,000 during this past
year. Another example, on a smaller scale but of significance
nonetheless, is the initiative taken by a family in Buffalo,
New York: here, in their home, they have been assisting tens
of children and youth from the inner city to develop, through
Bahá’í spiritual and moral teachings, patterns of behavior that
will enable them to overcome self-destructive attitudes bred by
poverty and racism.
In the area of external affairs, the most energetic actions
have been prompted by two tragic happenings in Iran. The
sudden execution in Mashhad last July of Mr. Rúh.u’lláh
Rawh.ání, the first such official action in six years, registered a
shock that provoked a worldwide and unprecedented outcry by
governments and United Nations agencies. In late September
the government’s intelligence agency launched an organized
attack on the Bahá’í Institute of Higher Education, involving
the arrest of 36 members of the faculty and raids on more than
500 homes across the country. The latter incident inspired a
global campaign of protest, still in progress, in which academic
institutions and associations, educators, and student groups
have been participating, and in which the press has taken a
special interest, as reflected in the appearance of substantial
articles in Le Monde, The New York Times and other major
newspapers. The successful passage in the United Nations
General Assembly last December of yet another resolution on
Iran, in which the Bahá’ís are distinctly mentioned, must surely
have been influenced by these two conspicuous manifestations
of an unrelenting religious persecution.
But intensive as has been the demand upon the friends
in all parts of the world to defend our beleaguered brethren,
much attention was devoted as well to a wide range of
external affairs endeavors. The four-month-long mission undertaken by an emissary of the House of Justice, Mr. Giovanni
Ballerio, to islands of the Pacific Ocean where he met with
22 heads of state, 5 heads of government and more than 40
other high-ranking officials; the efforts pursued by a number of
National Assemblies, at the urging of the Bahá’í International
Community’s United Nations Office, to promote human rights
education; the participation, by invitation, of representatives
of South Africa’s Bahá’í community in the proceedings of the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, at which they were able
114

18.8

18.9

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

18.10

18.11

to recount their record of unflinching support of racial unity
throughout the years of apartheid; the recent success of communities in Australia, Brazil, Finland and Portugal in obtaining
the decision of educational authorities to include courses on
the Bahá’í Faith in the curricula of primary and secondary
schools—these, not to mention the public information projects
that generated publicity through all forms of the media, are
examples of the broadly based enterprises in external affairs
that engaged the energies of the community.
A corollary spate of activities involved the use of the arts,
of which the musical and other artistic performances associated
with the celebration in Paris of the centenary of the establishment of the Faith in Europe were an outstanding instance. The
Voices of Bahá Choir, composed of 68 members drawn from
Europe and the Americas, delighted audiences in eight European
cities and introduced the Faith to many. “Light and Fire,” the
completed part of an opera/ballet being written by Bahá’í composer Lasse Thoresen of Norway, was successfully performed
last September at the prestigious music festival in Poland known
as the Warsaw Autumn, which was opened by the Queen of
Sweden. The work is based on recent heroic acts of the martyrs
in Iran, a fact that exposed the audience to knowledge of the
Faith. Europe’s apparent lead in these particular endeavors was
also marked by the occasion of the Austrian Chamber Music
Festival when the Austrian Cross for Sciences and Arts, the
highest award of its kind for Austria, was presented by the
President of the Republic to Mr. Bijan Khadem-Missagh, a
Bahá’í violinist and conductor. A program at that same Festival
featured the recitation of extracts from Bahá’í and other sacred
scriptures. But a word, too, must be said in recognition of the
prominent part being played by youth all over the world in their
employment of the arts in the teaching work; renditions by their
dance workshops, in particular, have acquired renown within
and outside the Bahá’í community.
We therefore enter this Rid.ván season, as a community in a
dynamic state of transformation, enjoying a coherence of vision
and activity consonant with the aim of advancing the process
of entry by troops. And we begin the final year of the Plan
with a boost in administrative strength, as three countries in
Europe—Latvia, Lithuania and Macedonia—convoke their first
Conventions to form National Spiritual Assemblies and thus
raise the number of pillars of the Universal House of Justice
115

to 182. But beyond this festive moment is a chronology of
expectations that lists, first and foremost, the conclusion of the
Four Year Plan at Rid.ván 2000. This will be followed by the
commencement on the Day of the Covenant of that very year of
a new term of office for the Continental Boards of Counsellors,
whose members will soon thereafter be called to the Bahá’í
World Centre for a conference at which, among other matters,
the features of the next global teaching and consolidation plan
will be discussed. The Counsellors’ Conference will mark the
occupation by the International Teaching Centre of its permanent seat, an occasion for which Auxiliary Board members
throughout the world will be invited to join the Counsellors
in the Holy Land. The Mount Carmel projects will have been
completed by this time and the preparations will have been well
advanced for dedicatory events, scheduled to take place on 22
and 23 May 2001, to which a number of representatives from
each national Bahá’í community will be invited. The details
concerning these events are to be announced in due course.
This projection of portentous happenings cuts across the
divide in time between the twentieth century and the new millennium, according to the reckoning of the common era. It is a
projection that underscores the contrast between the confident
vision that propels the constructive endeavors of an illumined
community and the tangled fears seizing the millions upon
millions who are as yet unaware of the Day in which they are
living. Bereft of authentic guidance, they dwell on the horrors
of the century, despairing over what these could imply for the
future, hardly appreciating that this very century contains a
light that will be shed on centuries to come. Ill-equipped to
interpret the social commotion at play throughout the planet,
they listen to the pundits of error and sink deeper into a slough
of despond. Troubled by forecasts of doom, they do battle with
the phantoms of a wrongly informed imagination. Knowing
nothing of the transformative vision vouchsafed by the Lord
of the Age, they stumble ahead, blind to the peerlessness of the
new Day of God.
The pitiful conditions implied by such a state of heart and
mind cannot but prompt us all to action, unabating action, to
fulfill the intentions of a Plan whose major aim is to accelerate
that process which will make it possible for growing numbers
of the world’s people to find the Object of their quest and thus
to build a united, peaceful and prosperous life.

Dearly loved Friends,

On this special day, when our hearts and thoughts are
focused on the immortal example set by the life of the Center of
the Covenant, we pause to note, with feelings of deep gratitude,
the current progress of the Divine Plan which He conceived,
and to glance at the future beyond the four-year stage now
rapidly coming to an end.
The accomplishments during this period are encouraging
indeed. An impressive network of training institutes on a scale
but dimly imagined at the start of the Plan has been established
throughout the world. These nascent centers of learning have
made significant strides in developing formal programs and in
putting into place effective systems for the delivery of courses.
Reports indicate that the number of believers benefiting directly
from training courses has climbed to nearly 100,000. Without
question, the capacity of the worldwide community to develop
its human resources has been distinctly enhanced.
The effects of this systematic approach to human resource
development are making themselves felt in the lives of all three
protagonists of the Plan—the individual believer, the institutions, and the local community. There has been an upsurge in
teaching activities undertaken at the initiative of the individual.
Spiritual Assemblies, Councils, and committees have grown
in their ability to guide the believers in their individual and
collective endeavors. And community life has flourished, even
in localities long dormant, as new patterns of thought and
behavior have emerged.
As we survey the Bahá’í world, we see a greatly strengthened community, internally sound and notably reinforced. Its
achievements in reaching the general public, governments and
organizations of civil society and in winning trust in all these
119

circles are striking. Agencies specialized in external affairs,
following a well-defined strategy, have broadened the range of
the Faith’s influence nationally and internationally, and projects
of social and economic development, which seek the spiritual
and material upliftment of entire communities, are penetrating
society at the grassroots.
The two stages in the unfoldment of the Divine Plan lying
immediately ahead will last one year and five years respectively.
At Rid.ván 2000 the Bahá’í world will be asked to embark on
the first of these two stages, a twelve-month effort aimed at
concentrating the forces, the capacities and the insights that
have so strongly emerged. The Five Year Plan that follows will
initiate a series of worldwide enterprises that will carry the
Bahá’í community through the final twenty years in the first
century of the Faith’s Formative Age. These global Plans will
continue to focus on advancing the process of entry by troops
and on its systematic acceleration.
It is essential that, during the one-year effort, national and
regional institutes everywhere bring into full operation the
programs and systems that they have now devised. National
communities should enter the Five Year Plan confident that the
acquisition of knowledge, qualities and skills of service by large
contingents of believers, with the aid of a sequence of courses,
will proceed unhindered. Ample attention must also be given to
further systematization of teaching efforts, whether undertaken
by the individual or directed by the institutions. In this respect,
the International Teaching Centre has identified certain patterns
of systematic expansion and consolidation for relatively small
geographical areas consisting of a manageable number of localities. Through the collaboration of Counsellors and National
Spiritual Assemblies, several “Area Growth Programs” are
being established in each continent. They will be carefully
monitored during the Twelve Month Plan and their methods
will be refined so that this approach can be incorporated into
subsequent Plans.
Strategies to advance the process of entry by troops cannot
ignore children and junior youth, if the victories won in one
generation are not to be lost with the passage of time. It is
imperative, then, that at this point in the process of systematization of the teaching work, definite steps be taken to ensure
that the vision of the community fully embraces its younger
members. The education of children, an obligation enjoined on
120

19.5

19.6

19.7

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

19.8

both parents and institutions, requires special emphasis so as
to become thoroughly integrated into the process of community
development. This activity should be taken to new levels of
intensity during these twelve months and then be further raised
in the years immediately after. That the programs of most
institutes in the world provide for the training of children’s class
teachers represents an element of strength. Spiritual Assemblies
and Auxiliary Board members will need to mobilize these newly
trained human resources to meet the spiritual requirements of
children and junior youth.
The period of the Twelve Month Plan will be marked by
great activity in society at large as the twentieth century draws
to a close. Already keen interest is being shown by leaders of
thought in the destiny of the coming generations, and we hope
that the fervor of the Bahá’í community, both in its internal
operation and its interactions with society, will convey a sense
of confidence in the future of humanity.
We will pray ardently in the Holy Shrines that Bahá’u’lláh
will bless your exertions to bring the Four Year Plan to a
triumphal conclusion.

Dear Friends,

You have come together to examine the progress of a youth
movement which embraces larger and larger numbers of participants from generation to generation. As you deliberate on the
issues before you, you can take pride in the accomplishments of
the community of the Greatest Name in your continent. Youth
have played a key role in the impressive unfoldment of the Four
Year Plan throughout Latin America, and you can look forward
with confidence to the harvest you are destined to reap.
As we recently stated, advancing the process of entry by
troops will remain the focus of the global Plans that will carry
the Bahá’í community to the end of the first century of the
Formative Age. You and those who will be attracted to the
Faith through your teaching efforts will bring about signal
developments that will mark this twenty-one year period. As a
result of recent endeavors to consolidate the work of institutes,
your communities are now endowed with the capacity to address the training needs of your rapidly growing ranks. This
training will help you exploit the opportunities offered you at
this crucial moment in history. In the face of these opportunities, you need to examine and shape the discourse in which you
will engage.
At the end of the twentieth century, the majority of the
population of Latin America is under the age of 30. As this
generation of youth assumes the responsibilities of conducting
the affairs of society, it will encounter a landscape of bewildering contrast. On the one hand, the region can justly boast
brilliant achievements in the intellectual, technological and economic spheres. On the other, it has failed to reduce widespread
poverty or to avoid a rising sea of violence that threatens to
submerge its peoples. Why—and the question needs to be asked
123

20.1

20.3

Turning Point

20.4

20.5

20.6

plainly—has this society been impotent, despite its great wealth,
to remove the injustices that are tearing its fiber apart?
The answer to this question, as amply evidenced by decades
of contentious history, cannot be found in political passion,
conflicting expressions of class interest, or technical recipes.
What is called for is a spiritual revival, as a prerequisite to the
successful application of political, economic and technological
instruments. But there is a need for a catalyst. Be assured that,
in spite of your small numbers, you are the channels through
which such a catalyst can be provided.
Be not dismayed if your endeavors are dismissed as utopian
by the voices that would oppose any suggestion of fundamental
change. Trust in the capacity of this generation to disentangle
itself from the embroilments of a divided society. To discharge
your responsibilities, you will have to show forth courage, the
courage of those who cling to standards of rectitude, whose
lives are characterized by purity of thought and action, and
whose purpose is directed by love and indomitable faith. As
you dedicate yourselves to healing the wounds with which
your peoples have been afflicted, you will become invincible
champions of justice.
We assure you of our loving prayers for the success of your
deliberations.

To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
21.1

21.2

21.3

We bow our heads in gratitude to the Lord of Hosts, our
hearts brimming with joy, as we witness how marvelous a difference four years have made since the launching of the global
Plan now concluded at this Festival of Splendors. So marked
was the progress achieved during this period that our world
community attained heights from which bright new horizons
for its future exploits can clearly be discerned.
The quantitative difference resulted mainly from a more
critical qualitative difference. The culture of the Bahá’í community experienced a change. This change is noticeable in the
expanded capability, the methodical pattern of functioning and
the consequent depth of confidence of the three constituent
participants in the Plan—the individual, the institutions and
the local community. That is so because the friends concerned
themselves more consistently with deepening their knowledge
of the divine Teachings and learned much—and this more
systematically than before—about how to apply them to
promulgating the Cause, to managing their individual and
collective activities, and to working with their neighbors. In a
word, they entered into a learning mode from which purposeful
action was pursued. The chief propellant of this change was the
system of training institutes established throughout the world
with great rapidity—an accomplishment which, in the field of
expansion and consolidation, qualifies as the single greatest
legacy of the Four Year Plan.
In the increased capacity of individuals to teach the Faith,
as shown in the thrust of individual initiatives; in the improved
ability of Spiritual Assemblies, Councils and committees to
guide the endeavors of the friends; in the introduction of new
patterns of thought and action which influenced the collective
125

21.1

21.2

21.3

Turning Point

21.4

21.5

behavior of the local community—in all such respects the
system of training institutes demonstrated its indispensability as
an engine of the process of entry by troops. By extending their
operation through local study circles, many institutes magnified their capacity to cover wide regions with their programs.
Mongolia, for instance, set up 106 study circles and, as a result,
recorded a significant rise in the number of new believers.
Concurrent with these kinds of developments, the members of
our worldwide community also gave more attention to drawing
on the power of prayer, to meditating on the sacred Word, and
to deriving the spiritual benefits of participation in devotional
gatherings. It is through the workings of these elements of an
intensified individual and collective transformation that the
size of the community is increasing. Although the number of
new believers has as yet only slightly surpassed those of recent
years, it is immensely gratifying to see that this increase is now
geographically widespread, is engaging ever-larger segments of
the community, and is successful in integrating new declarants
into the life of the Cause.
So salutary, so promising a condition of the Faith also owes
much, beyond measure, to the advisory influence, collaborative
role and practical work of the institution of the Counsellors
which were amplified with respect to the formation and operation of institutes—an amplification that reflected the timely
stimulation imparted by a vibrant and ever alert International
Teaching Centre.
The central theme of the Four Year Plan—that of advancing
the process of entry by troops—produced a high degree of integration of thought and action. It focused attention on a major
stage of the evolution of the Bahá’í community that must be
attained during the Formative Age; for until entry by troops is
more widely sustained, the conditions will not be ripe for mass
conversion, that breakthrough promised by Shoghi Effendi in
his writings. The thematic focus of the Plan bore implications
for all categories of Bahá’í activity; it called for a clarity of
understanding which made possible systematic and strategic
planning as a prerequisite of individual and collective action.
The members of the community came gradually to appreciate
how systematization would facilitate the processes of growth
and development. This raising of consciousness was a huge step
that led to an upgrading of teaching activities and a change in
the culture of the community.
126

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice
21.6

21.7

The integrative aspects of the theme were evident in the
­efforts at planning, building institutional capacity, and developing human resources. The threads connecting all these can be
traced from the outset of the Plan to its very end. The December
1995 Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors in the
Holy Land marked the beginning. There the Counsellors were
oriented to the features of the Plan. This was followed by their
consultations with National Spiritual Assemblies in national
planning sessions that moved subsequently to the regional level,
involving Auxiliary Board members, Local Spiritual Assemblies
and committees. Thus, at all levels, elements of the Bahá’í
administration became involved in the planning process, and
reached beyond this stage to that of implementation, at which
the institutional capacity to cope with entry by troops had to be
created. Two major steps were taken in this regard: one was the
establishment of training institutes; the other was the formal
establishment and widespread introduction of Regional Bahá’í
Councils as a feature of the administration between the local
and national levels to strengthen the administrative capacity of
certain communities where the growing complexity of the issues
facing National Spiritual Assemblies required this development.
Equally of relevance to integrating the essentials of the process
were the strategies defined for the work in social and economic
development, which is a critical part of consolidation, and in
external affairs, which is a vital factor in enabling the Faith to
manage the consequences of its emergence from obscurity. The
combined effect produced resounding results, the enumeration
of which would far exceed the compass of these pages. We are
moved, however, to cite certain highlights that illustrate the
scope of the Plan’s achievements.
In the Holy Land, the construction of the Terraces and
the buildings on the Arc forged ahead with every assurance
of meeting the announced deadline for their completion at the
end of this Gregorian year. Moreover, the building in Haifa to
which we referred in our last Rid.ván message in connection
with the expanded size of pilgrimage groups is ready for use
as of this Rid.ván. In this same connection, architectural plans
were approved for the much-needed facility to be built at Bahjí
to accommodate pilgrims and other Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í visitors. The translation of the Texts for the expected new volume
of Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings has been completed and preparations
are under way for its publication.

Strides in expansion and consolidation were manifest
in ways other than those already mentioned: in pioneering,
proclamation, the publication of literature, the use of the arts,
the formation of Spiritual Assemblies, and advances of Bahá’í
studies associations. Some 3,300 believers settled as long- and
short-term international pioneers. That many countries usually on the receiving end had themselves dispatched pioneers
abroad was a further indication of the maturation of national
communities. True to the mandate addressed to their members,
the Canadian and United States communities excelled in the
number of pioneers that left their shores and in the much
greater number of traveling teachers, including a significant
representation of youth. Especially noteworthy, too, was the
heartening response of believers of African descent in the
United States to the call that Bahá’í teachers travel to Africa.
Proclamation of the Cause involved a variety of actions
which included the sponsoring of a wide range of occasions
—anniversaries, commemorations, discussion groups, exhibits,
and the like—that made it possible for large numbers of people
to become acquainted with the teachings of the Faith. The
Houses of Worship were magnetic centers for visitors who
entered their doors in increasing numbers, especially in India,
where some five million people were received during the last
year. Added to such activities were the multiple uses of the media to get the Bahá’í message across. In the United States, some
60,000 inquirers responded to a media campaign designed by
the National Teaching Committee. Worldwide, knowledge of
the Faith was spread through the appearance, more frequently
than before, of unsolicited, sympathetic articles in the print
media. There was a similar broadening of exposure through
readiness on the part of radio and television stations to include
regular Bahá’í programs; this was so in such countries as the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Liberia. Such fortunate
developments were crowned by the independent choice of
international media establishments to use the Shrine of the Báb
and the Terraces as the site for the telecast of the Holy Land’s
segment of the worldwide media program celebrating the arrival of the year 2000.
The use of the arts became an important feature in the
proclamation, teaching, deepening and devotional activities of
the worldwide community. The arts attracted young people,
who applied them to their teaching and deepening activities

principally through the numerous drama and dance workshops
active in many parts of the world. But the dynamics of the
arts went far beyond singing and dancing to involve a range
of imaginative activities that grounded people in the Cause.
Where folk art was used, particularly in Africa, the teaching
work was greatly enhanced. For example, Ghana and Liberia
each mounted a Light of Unity Project for promoting the arts
in teaching. In India, the Communal Harmony Group had a
similar purpose.
Mostly at the urging of the Counsellors and with the
support of the Continental Fund, a boost was given to the
translation and publication of Bahá’í literature especially in
Africa and Asia. Moreover, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas appeared in a
complete Arabic edition and in other languages.
While the restriction of the formation of Local Spiritual
Assemblies to the first day of Rid.ván, which took effect in
1997, produced the anticipated decrease in the number of these
institutions, the fall was not drastic. The number has since held
its ground and a sound process of consolidation is in place.
Seven new pillars of the Universal House of Justice were raised
up, bringing the total of National Spiritual Assemblies to 181.
Particularly gratifying has been the gathering momentum,
during these four years, of Bahá’í scholarly activity, which
forged ahead with the vital task of reinforcing the intellectual
foundations of the Faith’s work. Two invaluable results have
been the impressive enrichment of Bahá’í literature and the
production of a body of dissertations examining various
contemporary problems in the light of Bahá’í principles. The
network of Associations of Bahá’í Studies, celebrating this year
its twenty-fifth anniversary, welcomed five new affiliates during
the Plan. Reflective of the diversity and creativity that this field
of service is attracting were the holding of Papua New Guinea’s
first Bahá’í studies conference and the Japanese Association’s
ground-breaking focus on the spiritual origins of traditional
Japanese scholarship.
Progress in the field of social and economic development
was decidedly qualitative, although figures showing an increase
of projects were also impressive. Annually reported activities
grew from some 1,600 at the beginning of the Plan to more
than 1,900 nearing its end. The movement towards a more
systematic approach remained the dominant characteristic
of the work during this period. To promote consultation and
129

21.11

21.12

21.13

21.14

Turning Point

21.15

action on the principles of social and economic development,
the Office of Social and Economic Development at the Bahá’í
World Centre sponsored 13 regional seminars in which an
estimated 700 representatives from 60 countries participated.
This Office also attended to the devising of pilot projects and
materials suitable for the mounting of organized campaigns
to foster youth empowerment and literacy, community health
worker training, the advancement of women, and moral education. An example was the program in Guyana that trained more
than 1,500 literacy facilitators; another was the completion
in Malaysia of eight modules for the advancement of women,
which became the basis for training sessions held in Africa, Asia
and Latin America. A plan to integrate Bahá’í radio stations
with the work of training institutes was initiated in the Guaymi
region of Panama. As institutes have the potential to provide
training for social and economic development, a movement in
that direction involved a dozen institutes, which are currently
experimenting with such efforts in areas including literacy,
community health worker training, and vocational training.
A number of Bahá’í-sponsored and Bahá’í-inspired agencies
have devoted their energies to projects, such as the one which
involved collaboration with the World Health Organization
in combating river blindness in Cameroon; more than 30,000
individuals have received the needed medication through this
Bahá’í project. Another instance is the private university in
Ethiopia, Unity College, whose student body has risen to
8,000. Another is Landegg Academy in Switzerland, which,
while expanding and consolidating its academic program,
extended highly appreciated assistance in the ongoing quest for
a remedy to the horrendous social consequences of conflict in
the Balkans. Yet another is Núr University in Bolivia, which, in
a collaborative project with Ecuador, offered training to more
than 1,000 school teachers in its moral leadership program. In
this field of social and economic development, such evidences
of capacity building were a great benefit to the purposes of
the Plan.
Guided by the external affairs strategy communicated to
National Spiritual Assemblies in 1994, the community’s capacity in the fields of diplomatic and public information likewise
expanded at an astonishing rate, placing the Bahá’í community
in a dynamic relationship with the United Nations, governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the media.
130

21.16

The strategy focused activities at international and national
levels on two key objectives: to influence the processes towards
world peace, and to defend the Faith. Through the measures
adopted for the defense of our dearly loved co-religionists in
Iran, the Bahá’í International Community won a new measure
of respect and support that created opportunities for other
aims of the strategy to be pursued. To meet the challenge of
the intractable situation in Iran, our institutions and external
affairs agencies devised new approaches to activating available
instruments of governments and the United Nations. The case
of the persecutions in Iran occupied the attention of the highest authorities on the planet. Indeed, the news that an Iranian
court had reaffirmed death sentences for two of the friends and
imposed a similar sentence on a third evoked a sharp response
from the President of the United States, who issued a clear
admonition to Iran. As a consequence of the interventions of
world leaders and the United Nations, the executions of Iranian
Bahá’ís virtually stopped and the number of those sentenced to
long-term imprisonment was drastically reduced.
While we have welcomed these interventions, we acclaim
the self-sacrificing spirit, the fortitude, and the indomitable
faith of our brothers and sisters in Iran that have invested such
efforts with potency. These manifest qualities of the soul baffle
their compatriots as to the stamina with which they withstand
the assaults so viciously and so relentlessly unloosed against
them. How else could one explain that so few have been able
to stand up to so many for so long? How else could they have
aroused the active concern of the world when even a single
one of them faces the threat of death? Iran’s tragedy is that
the assailants have until now failed to see that the divine
principles for which these persecuted ones have sacrificed
their possessions and even their lives contain the very solutions that would satisfy the yearnings of a population in its
hour of discontent. But there can be no doubt whatever that
the systematic tyranny to which our Iranian friends have so
cruelly been subjected will ultimately yield to the Almighty
Power guiding the mysterious proceedings toward their assured destiny in all its promised glory.
With regard to the other objective of the external affairs
strategy, the lines of action were guided by four themes—­human
rights, the status of women, global prosperity, and moral
development. Our records show a huge step forward in the
131

21.16

21.17

Turning Point

21.18

21.19

work on human rights and the status of women. With regard
to the former, the United Nations Office prosecuted a creative
program of human rights education which has, so far, served as
a means of building the capacity of no fewer than 99 National
Spiritual Assemblies for diplomatic work. Regarding the status
of women, the existence of 52 national offices for the advancement of women, the contributions of numerous Bahá’í women
and men to conferences and workshops at all levels, the selection of Bahá’í representatives to crucial positions on key NGO
committees, including the one that serves the United Nations
Development Fund for Women, show how the followers of
Bahá’u’lláh assiduously promote His principle of the equality
of women and men.
At the same time an array of initiatives are disseminating
information about the Bahá’í Faith to various publics. These
include such innovative undertakings as: the launching of “The
Bahá’í World” Web site, which is already averaging 25,000
visits a month; the issuing of a statement entitled “Who Is
Writing the Future?,” which is helping the friends everywhere
talk about contemporary issues; the airing since last November
on the World Wide Web of “Payam-e-Doost,” the Persianlanguage radio program broadcast for an hour weekly in the
Washington, D.C., metropolitan area—a program which is
available at all times throughout the world on the Internet; and
the implementation of a highly original television program, applying moral principles to day-to-day problems, which has won
the warm endorsement of government authorities in Albania,
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania,
Slovenia, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
A phenomenon that has gathered force as the century draws
to its end is that the people of the world have arisen to express
their aspirations through what has come to be known as the
“organizations of civil society.” It must be a source of great
satisfaction to Bahá’ís everywhere that the Bahá’í International
Community as an NGO representing a cross-section of humankind has won such trust as a unifying agent in major discussions
shaping the future of humankind. Our principal representative
at the United Nations was appointed to co-chair a committee
of nongovernmental organizations—a position that is giving
the Bahá’í International Community a leading role in the
organization of the Millennium Forum. This gathering, called
by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and scheduled to be held
132

21.18

21.19

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

21.20

in May, will give organizations of civil society an ­opportunity
to formulate views and recommendations on global issues
which will be taken up at the subsequent Millennium Summit
in September of this year to be attended by heads of state and
government.
Humanity’s awakening to the spiritual dimensions of the
changes occurring in the world has a special significance for
Bahá’ís. The interfaith dialogue has intensified. During the Four
Year Plan it increasingly involved the Faith as a recognized
participant. The Parliament of the World’s Religions held in
Cape Town last December brought together some 6,000 attendees, among whom was a strong Bahá’í delegation. Bahá’ís
served on both the South African and International Boards of
Directors that planned the event. For Bahá’ís, interest in the
occasion arose particularly from the fact that the first mention
of the Name of Bahá’u’lláh at a public gathering in the Western
Hemisphere had occurred at the Parliament held in Chicago in
1893. Two inter-religious events held in Jordan last November
included Bahá’ís as invited ­participants: a conference on conflict
and religion in the Middle East, and the annual meeting of the
World Conference on Religion and Peace. Bahá’í representatives attended events in Vatican City and New Delhi sponsored
by the Roman Catholic Church; on the latter occasion, in the
presence of Pope John Paul II, Counsellor Zena Sorabjee was
one of the representatives of religions addressing the gathering.
In the United Kingdom, the Faith was placed in the public
arena when Bahá’í representatives joined members of eight
other major religions for an interfaith celebration of the new
millennium in the Royal Gallery of Westminster Palace, where,
in the presence of Royalty, the Prime Minister, the Archbishop
of Canterbury and other distinguished persons, reference was
made to the gathering of the “nine major religions of the United
Kingdom.” In Germany, for the first time Bahá’ís were included
in an interfaith dialogue. This reversed a longstanding attitude
of Christian denominations which had avoided contact with
the Faith owing to a book written by a Covenant-breaker and
issued by a Lutheran publishing house in 1981. The remedy
was provided in a 600-page scholarly rebuttal written by three
Bahá’ís and published in 1995 by a leading non-Bahá’í firm,
representing a signal victory for the German Bahá’í community. An English translation was published in the last year
of the Plan. Interfaith dialogue took an unusual form when
133

21.20

Turning Point

21.21

at Lambeth Palace in 1998 representatives of the World Bank
and of nine major religions held a meeting which led to the
formation of the World Faiths Development Dialogue. The announced aim of the Dialogue is to try to bridge the gap between
the faith communities and the World Bank in order to enable
them to work together more effectively to overcome world
poverty. The frequency and wide embrace of interfaith gatherings represent a new phenomenon in the relations among the
religions. It is apparent that the various religious communities
are striving to achieve the spirit of friendliness and fellowship
among themselves that Bahá’u’lláh urged His followers to show
towards the followers of other religions.
The concentrated endeavor of the Bahá’í community in
these four years occurred at a time when the wider society
grappled with a torrent of conflicting interests. In this brief
but intensely dynamic span, the forces at work in the Bahá’í
community and throughout the world proceeded with relentless
acceleration. In their wake were revealed more conspicuously
than before the social phenomena to which Shoghi Effendi
alluded. More than six decades ago, he had called attention to
the “simultaneous processes of rise and of fall, of integration
and of disintegration, of order and chaos, with their continuous
and reciprocal reactions on each other.” These twin processes
did not continue in isolation from those specific to the Bahá’í
community but at times proceeded in such a way as to invite,
as has already been shown, the direct involvement of the Faith.
They seemed to run at opposite sides of the same corridor
of time. On one side, wars fomented by religious, political,
racial or tribal conflict raged in some 40 places; sudden, total
breakdown of civil order paralyzed a number of countries;
terrorism as a political weapon became epidemic; a surge of international criminal networks raised alarm. Yet on the opposite
side, attempts at implementing and elaborating the methods of
collective security were earnestly made, bringing to mind one
of Bahá’u’lláh’s prescriptions for maintaining peace; a call was
raised for an international criminal court to be established,
another action that accords with Bahá’í expectations; to focus
attention on the imperative need for an adequate system to
deal with global issues, world leaders are scheduled to meet in
a Millennium Summit; new methods of communications have
opened the way for everyone to communicate with anyone on
the planet. The economic disintegration in Asia threatened to
134

21.21

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

21.22

21.23

destabilize the world economy, but it prompted efforts both to
remedy the immediate situation and to find ways of bringing
a sense of equity to international trade and finance. These
are but a few examples of the two contrasting but interactive
tendencies operating at this time, confirming Shoghi Effendi’s
inspired summation of the forces at work in God’s greater plan,
“whose ultimate objectives are the unity of the human race and
the peace of all mankind.”
At the conclusion of these four eventful years, we have
arrived at a portentous convergence of ends and beginnings in
measures of Gregorian time and the Bahá’í era. In one instance,
this convergence entails the wrapping up of the twentieth century and, in the other, opens a new stage in the unfolding of the
Formative Age. The perspective from these two frames of time
prompts us to reflect on a vision of world-shaping trends that
have synchronized, and to do so in the context of the insight
so graphically projected by Shoghi Effendi at the inception
of the Arc he conceived. During the course of the Plan, this
vision assumed a brilliant clarity as the construction projects
advanced on Mount Carmel, as world leaders took bold steps
towards fashioning the structures of a global political peace,
and as local and national Bahá’í institutions moved to new
levels in their evolution. We carry with us a sacred and enduring
memory of the twentieth century that stirs our energies even as
it sets our path: It is of that seminal moment in the history of
humankind when the Center of the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh,
during an unparalleled ministry, designed the architecture of a
new World Order and when, subsequently during some of the
most devastating years, the Guardian of the Faith devoted his
utmost energies to raising up the structures of an Administrative
System that, at the end of the century, stands before the gaze of
the world in the wholeness of its essential form. We come thus
to a bridge between times. The capacities developed through
a century of struggle and sacrifice by a handful of intoxicated
lovers of Bahá’u’lláh must now be applied to the inescapable
tasks remaining to the Formative Age, whose many epochs of
unremitting labor will lead to that Golden Age of our Faith
when the Most Great Peace will envelop the earth.
We begin at this Rid.ván with a Twelve Month Plan. Brief
though it is, it must and will suffice to accomplish certain vital
tasks and to lay the ground for the next twenty-year thrust of
the Master’s Divine Plan. What was so carefully begun four
135

21.22

21.23

Turning Point

21.24

years ago—the systematic acquisition of knowledge, qualities
and skills of service—must be augmented. Wherever they exist,
national and regional institutes must activate to the full the
programs and systems they have adopted. New institutes must
be formed where such needs have been identified. Greater steps
must be taken to systematize the teaching work undertaken
through individual initiative and institutional sponsorship. It is
partly for this purpose that in several areas of each continent
the Counsellors and the National Assemblies have established
“Area Growth Programs.” The results will provide a body of
experience for the benefit of future Plans. The individual, the
institutions and the local community are urged to focus their
attention on these essential tasks, so as to be fully prepared for
the five-year enterprise to begin at Rid.ván 2001—an enterprise
that will take the Bahá’í world to the next phase in the advancement of the process of entry by troops.
But beyond giving attention to these tasks, there is a pressing challenge to be faced: Our children need to be nurtured
spiritually and to be integrated into the life of the Cause. They
should not be left to drift in a world so laden with moral
dangers. In the current state of society, children face a cruel
fate. Millions and millions in country after country are dislocated socially. Children find themselves alienated by parents
and other adults whether they live in conditions of wealth or
poverty. This alienation has its roots in a selfishness that is born
of materialism that is at the core of the godlessness seizing the
hearts of people everywhere. The social dislocation of children
in our time is a sure mark of a society in decline; this condition
is not, however, confined to any race, class, nation or economic
condition—it cuts across them all. It grieves our hearts to realize that in so many parts of the world children are employed as
soldiers, exploited as laborers, sold into virtual slavery, forced
into prostitution, made the objects of pornography, abandoned
by parents centered on their own desires, and subjected to
other forms of victimization too numerous to mention. Many
such horrors are inflicted by the parents themselves upon their
own children. The spiritual and psychological damage defies
estimation. Our worldwide community cannot escape the
consequences of these conditions. This realization should spur
us all to urgent and sustained effort in the interests of children
and the future.

136

Even though children’s activities have been a part of past
Plans, these have fallen short of the need. Spiritual education
of children and junior youth are of paramount importance to
the further progress of the community. It is therefore imperative
that this deficiency be remedied. Institutes must be certain to
include in their programs the training of teachers of children’s
classes, who can make their services available to local communities. But although providing spiritual and academic
education for children is essential, this represents only a part
of what must go into developing their characters and shaping
their personalities. The necessity exists, too, for individuals and
the institutions at all levels, which is to say the community as a
whole, to show a proper attitude towards children and to take
a general interest in their welfare. Such an attitude should be
far removed from that of a rapidly declining order.
Children are the most precious treasure a community can
possess, for in them are the promise and guarantee of the future.
They bear the seeds of the character of future society which is
largely shaped by what the adults constituting the community
do or fail to do with respect to children. They are a trust no
community can neglect with impunity. An all-­embracing love
of children, the manner of treating them, the quality of the
attention shown them, the spirit of adult behavior toward
them—these are all among the vital aspects of the requisite
attitude. Love demands discipline, the courage to accustom
children to hardship, not to indulge their whims or leave them
entirely to their own devices. An atmosphere needs to be maintained in which children feel that they belong to the community
and share in its purpose. They must lovingly but insistently be
guided to live up to Bahá’í standards, to study and teach the
Cause in ways that are suited to their circumstances.
Among the young ones in the community are those known
as junior youth, who fall between the ages of, say, 12 and 15.
They represent a special group with special needs as they are
somewhat in between childhood and youth when many changes
are occurring within them. Creative attention must be devoted
to involving them in programs of activity that will engage
their interests, mold their capacities for teaching and service,
and involve them in social interaction with older youth. The
employment of the arts in various forms can be of great value
in such activity.

137

And now we wish to address a few words to parents, who
bear the primary responsibility for the upbringing of their
children. We appeal to them to give constant attention to the
spiritual education of their children. Some parents appear to
think that this is the exclusive responsibility of the community;
others believe that in order to preserve the independence of
children to investigate truth, the Faith should not be taught
to them. Still others feel inadequate to take on such a task.
None of this is correct. The beloved Master has said that “it
is enjoined upon the father and mother, as a duty, to strive
with all effort to train the daughter and the son,” adding that,
“should they neglect this matter, they shall be held responsible
and worthy of reproach in the presence of the stern Lord.”
Independent of the level of their education, parents are in a
critical position to shape the spiritual development of their
children. They should not ever underestimate their capacity
to mold their children’s moral character. For they exercise
indispensable influence through the home environment they
consciously create by their love of God, their striving to adhere
to His laws, their spirit of service to His Cause, their lack
of fanaticism, and their freedom from the corrosive effects
of backbiting. Every parent who is a believer in the Blessed
Beauty has the responsibility to conduct herself or himself in
such a way as to elicit the spontaneous obedience to parents
to which the Teachings attach so high a value. Of course,
in addition to the efforts made at home, the parents should
support Bahá’í children’s classes provided by the community.
It must be borne in mind, too, that children live in a world
that informs them of harsh realities through direct experience
with the horrors already described or through the unavoidable
outpourings of the mass media. Many of them are thereby
forced to mature prematurely, and among these are those who
look for standards and discipline by which to guide their lives.
Against this gloomy backdrop of a decadent society, Bahá’í
children should shine as the emblems of a better future.
Our expectations are alive with the thought that the
Continental Counsellors will gather in the Holy Land in
January 2001 on an occasion that will celebrate the occupation
by the International Teaching Centre of its permanent seat on
the Hill of God. Auxiliary Board members from throughout
the world will participate with them in what will undoubtedly
turn out to be one of the historic happenings of the Formative
138

21.30

Age. The coming together of such a constellation of Bahá’í
officers must by its very nature produce untold benefits for a
community which will again be close to ending one Plan and
embarking on another. As we contemplate the implications, we
turn our hearts in gratitude to the very dear Hands of the Cause
of God ‘Alí-Akbar Furútan and ‘Alí Muh.ammad Varqá, who by
their residence in the Holy Land hold aloft the torch of service
which the beloved Guardian lit in their hearts.
With this Twelve Month Plan, we cross a bridge to which
we shall never return. We launch this Plan in the earthly absence
of Amatu’l-Bahá Rúh.íyyih Khánum. She remained with us to
the virtual end of the twentieth century as a beam of the light
that had shone during that incomparable period in the history
of the human race. In the Tablets of the Divine Plan, the Master
lamented His inability to travel throughout the world to raise
the Divine call, and in the intensity of His disappointment He
penned the hope: “Please God, ye may achieve it.” Amatu’lBahá responded with boundless energy, touching far-flung spots
of the earth in the 185 countries that were privileged to receive
her inimitable gifts. Her example, which will retain forever its
splendor, illumines the hearts of thousands upon thousands
throughout the planet. Against the inadequacy of any other
gesture, might we all not dedicate our humble efforts during
this Plan to the memory of one for whom teaching was the
primary purpose, the perfect joy of life?

Dearly loved Friends,

Five years ago, we called on the body of Counsellors
­assembled in the Holy Land to aid the Bahá’í world to understand and shoulder the challenges of systematic growth.
The brilliant achievements of the Four Year Plan testify to the
wholehearted response they made. Today, we ask for an equally
great effort on your part, this time to ensure the successful
launching of the Five Year Plan.
In your deliberations on the nature of this next stage in the
unfoldment of the Divine Plan, you need to take into account
the magnitude of the changes occurring in the fortunes of the
Faith. At the World Centre, the raising of the great edifices now
standing on the Arc represents a major step in the consolidation of a divinely appointed Administrative Order. The Four
Year Plan witnessed a remarkable increase in the institutional
capacity of Bahá’í communities in every continent. The evolution of National and Local Spiritual Assemblies has visibly
accelerated, and Regional Councils, where they have been
established, have brought a new energy and effectiveness to the
work of the Cause. With the birth and efflorescence of more
than 300 training institutes, the Faith now possesses a powerful instrument for developing the human resources needed
to sustain large-scale expansion and consolidation. Further,
the ability of the Bahá’í community to influence the course of
human affairs, both through its dealings with governments and
organizations of civil society and through its endeavors in social
and economic development, has been greatly enhanced. The
Cause of Bahá’u’lláh stands at the threshold of a new epoch, at
a moment in history when, despite confusion and outbursts of
fresh hostility, the world has made real strides towards peace.

One clearly sees an increasing receptivity to His all-pervasive
and resplendent Spirit.
Advancing the process of entry by troops will continue
as the aim of the Five Year Plan—indeed the aim of the series
of Plans that will carry the community to the end of the first
century of the Formative Age. The acceleration of this vital
process will be achieved through systematic activity on the part
of the three participants in the Plan: the individual believer, the
institutions, and the community.

The Training Institute

22.5

22.6

A searching analysis of the Four Year Plan recently prepared for us by the International Teaching Centre demonstrates
that the training institute is effective not only in enhancing the
powers of the individual, but also in vitalizing communities and
institutions. The continued development of training institutes
in the diverse countries and territories of the world, then, must
be a central feature of the new Plan.
Drawing on the wealth of experience now accumulated
in this area of endeavor, institutes will have to provide their
communities with a constant stream of human resources to
serve the process of entry by troops. Elements of a system that
can meet the training needs of large numbers of believers have
already been tested worldwide and have proven themselves.
Study circles, reinforced by extension courses and special campaigns, have shown their ability to lend structure to the process
of spiritual education at the grassroots. The value of a sequence
of courses, each one following the other in a logical pattern and
each one building on the achievements of the previous ones,
has become abundantly clear. Various models are emerging that
provide insight into how such sequences can be used to create
training programs. In one example the main sequence, much
like the trunk of a tree, supports courses branching out from
it, each branch dedicated to some specific area of training. In
another, several tracks of courses, each with its own focus, run
parallel. Institutes will do well to examine these elements and
approaches and employ them in a manner that responds to the
opportunities before them.
At the outset of the Twelve Month Plan we ­ underscored
the need for Bahá’í children to be nurtured spiritually and
to be integrated into the life of the Cause. There is every
142

22.6

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

22.7

­indication from the response of the friends thus far that a raised
­awareness of the importance of child education will, in fact, be
a hallmark of this brief yet significant Plan. A new impetus has
been given to Bahá’í children’s classes. Increased awareness has
also brought to light opportunities to offer moral and spiritual
education to children in general, as exemplified by the success
of the efforts to introduce courses on the Bahá’í Faith into
programs of official school systems.
That institutes are placing more and more emphasis on the
training of teachers for children’s classes is a particularly encouraging sign. Other measures are equally essential if regular
classes for every age are to be offered in Bahá’í communities
throughout the world. In some countries, national and regional
committees have been established to assist Local Spiritual
Assemblies in the discharge of their responsibility to educate
children. In these, the relationship between the committees
and the training institute will steadily evolve as experience is
gained, each agency enhancing the work of the other. But there
are many countries in which the institute is the only structure
developing the capacity to organize and maintain courses in
locality after locality. As this approach is working well with
youth and adults, and increasingly for junior youth, there is
no reason why the training institute should not also shoulder
similar responsibility with respect to children, where necessary.
As a general rule, institutes do not take on the administration
of plans and programs for expansion and consolidation.
Conducting children’s classes, however, is a unique enterprise,
of special urgency. In those countries where the task is given to
it, the institute becomes a center of learning intensely engaged
in the spiritual education of the friends from the tenderest age
through adulthood.

22.7

Individual Initiative in Teaching
22.8

With the work of institutes growing in strength, attention
has now to be given everywhere to systematizing teaching efforts. In the document “The Institution of the Counsellors” just
issued, we emphasize the role that the Auxiliary Board members
and their assistants play in helping the friends to meet this challenge, both at the level of individual initiative and of collective
volition. As individuals progress through institute courses, they
deepen their knowledge of the Faith, gain insights, and acquire
143

22.8

Turning Point

22.9

skills of service. Some of the courses devoted to teaching will
no doubt treat the subject in general terms. Others will focus
on various means of sharing Bahá’u’lláh’s message with specific
segments of society, incorporating the wisdom gleaned from
the teaching endeavors of the friends. This combined process
of action, learning and training will endow communities with
an ever-increasing number of capable and eager teachers of
the Cause.
Training alone, of course, does not necessarily lead to an
upsurge in teaching activity. In every avenue of service, the
friends need sustained encouragement. Our expectation is that
the Auxiliary Board members, together with their assistants,
will give special thought to how individual initiative can be
cultivated, particularly as it relates to teaching. When training
and encouragement are effective, a culture of growth is nourished in which the believers see their duty to teach as a natural
consequence of having accepted Bahá’u’lláh. They “raise high
the sacred torch of faith,” as was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wish, “labor
ceaselessly, by day and by night,” and “consecrate every fleeting
moment of their lives to the diffusion of the divine fragrance
and the exaltation of God’s holy Word.” So enkindled do their
hearts become with the fire of the love of God that whoever
approaches them feels its warmth. They strive to be channels
of the spirit, pure of heart, selfless and humble, possessing
certitude and the courage that stems from reliance on God. In
such a culture, teaching is the dominating passion of the lives
of the believers. Fear of failure finds no place. Mutual support,
commitment to learning, and appreciation of diversity of action
are the prevailing norms.

22.9

Systematic Programs of Growth
22.10

During the coming months, you will be helping national
communities, whose circumstances differ widely, to formulate
plans for systematic growth. There are many countries where
increased institutional capacity, particularly at the level of the
region, now makes it possible to focus attention on smaller
geographic areas. Most of these will consist of a cluster of
villages and towns, but, sometimes, a large city and its suburbs
may constitute an area of this kind. Among the factors that
determine the boundaries of a cluster are culture, language, patterns of transport, infrastructure, and the social and economic
144

22.10

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

22.11

22.12

22.13

life of the inhabitants. The areas into which a region divides
will fall into various categories of development. Some will not
yet be open to the Faith, while others will contain a few isolated
localities and groups; in some, established communities will be
gaining strength through a vigorous institute process; in a few,
strong communities of deepened believers will be in a position
to take on the challenges of systematic and accelerated expansion and consolidation.
Once the appropriate categories have been identified, national plans in these countries will need to make provision for
the progressive opening of virgin areas through the settlement
of homefront pioneers. Such goals can be met with relative ease
if pioneers are experienced in institute programs and are able to
use their methods and materials in raising up a group of dedicated believers who can carry the work of the Faith forward in
the area. Precious indeed will be the privilege of those who, in
the remaining years of the first century of the Formative Age,
place their trust in God and arise with fervor to take the lead
in carrying the light of Divine guidance to every part of their
countries. It is our hope that this call for homefront pioneers
will generate great enthusiasm among the friends and open
before their eyes a new vista of possibilities to serve the Faith.
According to this scheme, national plans will also need to
include provision for the strengthening of other areas which,
although open to the Faith, have yet to reach the level of development that prepares them for intensive activity. In those areas
where strong communities with a corps of deepened believers
exist, systematic programs for the expansion and consolidation
of the Faith should be established forthwith. We have already
indicated that the International Teaching Centre has identified
certain patterns of growth appropriate for relatively small
geographical areas. Since then, it has analyzed several pilot
projects in various parts of the world, and its findings are
highly encouraging. The lessons learned now provide a body of
experience for the launching of programs for systematic growth
in area after area. As you consult on this matter with National
Spiritual Assemblies and Regional Councils, you will want to
keep the Teaching Centre informed.
It is important that national communities not rush into
establishing intensive programs in an area before conditions are
propitious. These conditions include: a high level of enthusiasm
among a sizeable group of devoted and capable believers who
145

22.11

22.12

22.13

Turning Point

22.14

22.15

22.16

understand the prerequisites for sustainable growth and can
take ownership of the program; some basic experience on the
part of a few communities in the cluster in holding classes for
the spiritual education of children, devotional meetings, and
the Nineteen Day Feast; the existence of a reasonable degree
of administrative capacity in at least a few Local Spiritual
Assemblies; the active involvement of several assistants to
Auxiliary Board members in promoting community life; a pronounced spirit of collaboration among the various institutions
working in the area; and above all, the strong presence of the
training institute with a scheme of coordination that supports
the systematic multiplication of study circles.
Programs initiated in such areas should aim at fostering
sustainable growth by building the necessary capacity at the
levels of the individual, the institution, and the community. Far
from requiring grandiose and elaborate plans, these programs
should focus on a few measures that have proven over the years
to be indispensable to large-scale expansion and consolidation.
Success will depend on the manner in which lines of action
are integrated and on the attitude of learning that is adopted.
The implementation of such a program will require the close
collaboration of the institute, the Auxiliary Board members and
their assistants, and an Area Teaching Committee.
At the core of the program must lie a sound and steady
process of expansion, matched by an equally strong process of
human resource development. A range of teaching efforts needs
to be carried out, involving both activities undertaken by the
individual and campaigns promoted by the institutions. As the
number of believers in the area rises, a significant percentage
should receive training from the institute, and their capabilities
be directed towards the development of local communities.
Our message of 26 December 1995 delineating the features
of the Four Year Plan made reference to the stages through
which a community passes as it develops. The experience that
has been gained in the ensuing years in working with communities at various stages will prove valuable to programs of
growth. One of the first steps in implementing the program may
well be a survey to determine the condition of each locality in
the area. Among the initial goals for every community should
be the establishment of study circles, children’s classes, and
devotional meetings, open to all the inhabitants of the locality.
The observance of the Nineteen Day Feast has to be given due
146

22.14

22.15

22.16

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

22.17

22.18

weight, and consistent effort should be made to strengthen
the Local Spiritual Assemblies. Once communities are able to
sustain the basic activities of Bahá’í life, a natural way to further their consolidation is to introduce small projects of social
and economic development—for example, a literacy project,
a project for the advancement of women or environmental
preservation, or even a village school. As strength builds, the
responsibility for an increasing number of lines of action is to
be devolved onto the Local Spiritual Assemblies.
Throughout the endeavor, periodic meetings of consultation
in the area need to reflect on issues, consider adjustments, and
maintain enthusiasm and unity of thought. The best approach
is to formulate plans for a few months at a time, beginning with
one or two lines of action and gradually growing in complexity.
Those who are actively involved in the implementation of plans,
whether members of the institutions or not, should be encouraged to participate fully in the consultations. Other area-wide
gatherings will also be necessary. Some of these will provide
opportunity for the sharing of experience and further training.
Others will focus on the use of the arts and the enrichment
of culture. Together, such gatherings will support an intense
process of action, consultation and learning.
The friends who participate in these intensive programs of
growth should bear in mind that the purpose is to ensure that
the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh reaches the masses of humanity
and enables them to achieve spiritual and material progress
through the application of the Teachings. Vast numbers among
the peoples of the world are ready, indeed yearn, for the bounties that Bahá’u’lláh alone can bestow upon them once they
have committed themselves to building the new society He has
envisioned. In learning to systematize their large-scale teaching
work, Bahá’í communities are becoming better equipped to
respond to this longing. They cannot withhold whatever effort,
whatever sacrifice, may be called for.

22.17

22.18

A Spiritual Enterprise
22.19

Clearly, the scheme described here, while suitable to many
national communities, cannot be applied in every situation. We
count on the ability of the Bahá’í institutions to create plans
which, if not reflecting the total scheme above, will incorporate elements of its vision, according to the circumstances of
147

22.19

Turning Point

22.20

each national community. Bahá’í communities are, of course,
engaged in a range of indispensable endeavors such as public information activity, proclamation efforts, external affairs work,
production of literature, and complex social and economic
development projects. Most certainly, as plans are devised, they
will also address these challenges.
The nature of the planning process with which you will be
helping the friends is in many ways unique. At its core it is a
spiritual process in which communities and institutions strive
to align their pursuits with the Will of God. The Major Plan
of God is at work and the forces it generates impel humanity
towards its destiny. In their own plans of action, the institutions
of the Faith must seek to gain insight into the operation of these
great forces, explore the potentialities of the people they serve,
measure the resources and strengths of their communities, and
take practical steps to enlist the unreserved participation of the
believers. The nurturing of this process is the sacred mission
entrusted to you. We have every confidence in your ability to
achieve it. May Bahá’u’lláh bless and sustain you through His
unfailing grace and mighty confirmations.

To the Conference Marking the Inauguration of
the International Teaching Centre Building
Dearly loved Friends,
23.1

23.2

23.3

23.4

We are filled with a sense of triumph as we reflect on the
significance of the occupation by the International Teaching
Centre of its permanent seat on the Mountain of the Lord. This
occasion marks the beginning of what future generations will
regard as a splendid chapter in the annals of our Faith.
What joy that the Hands of the Cause of God ‘Alí-Akbar
Furútan and ‘Alí-Muh.ammad Varqá are able to participate in
these proceedings! We acknowledge the great debt of gratitude
owed to them and to the departed ones of their exalted rank for
so much of what we have come to celebrate.
And how fitting it is that the Continental Counsellors and
their deputies from the five continents are here to witness such
an auspicious beginning! The attendance of the Auxiliary Board
members is so unusual a feature of the gathering that we are
impelled to address our remarks particularly to them. Indeed, on
no occasion in the past have the major constituents of the institution of the Counsellors ever assembled in the Holy Land.
With joyous hearts, we extend to every member of the
Auxiliary Boards a special and loving welcome. We hail this
opportunity to greet and thank these officers of an institution
the crucial importance of whose vital role in the progress of
the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh is increasingly demonstrated as the
Divine Plan unfolds. May we not at such a moment invoke,
above all, the memory of him in whose divinely inspired mind
the conception of Auxiliary Boards took shape? Up until the
time of his passing in 1957, Shoghi Effendi had called for the
appointment of seventy-two such officers, who were evenly
divided between the two Boards on each of the five continents;

149

23.1

23.2

23.4

Turning Point

23.5

23.6

23.7

23.8

with the institutional evolution that has taken place since then,
the number has increased to nearly one thousand.
With the International Teaching Centre having settled into
its position at the heart of a ramified, global institution, we
can readily recognize the fruition of the system set to extend
into the future the specialized functions of propagation and
protection originally assigned to the Hands of the Cause—a
system that has derived impetus from the guidance and
example of these irreplaceable appointees of Shoghi Effendi.
This achievement is in itself a thrilling indication of how well
the Cause is faring.
In you, the Auxiliary Board members here assembled, is
reflected the whole world of humanity. You hail from far-flung
geographic regions and cultural backgrounds that make you
truly representative of a cross-section of the human family.
Your coming here both reaffirms the existence of a dynamic,
global community and signalizes the possibilities for an advance
in the process of entry by troops far beyond any record yet
established. In this latter regard, the value of your immediate
future services cannot be overestimated.
The world’s crying need for the divine prescriptions is made
plain by the ills afflicting society at every level in all parts of
the planet. We must be swift in ministering to this need. Doing
so largely depends upon the revolutionary vision, the creative
drive and systematic effort of Auxiliary Board members and
their assistants, who prompt and encourage individuals,
institutions and communities to act with dispatch, constancy
and enthusiasm. Their operation at the grassroots, at the very
wellspring, of individual and collective activity, makes manageable the fulfillment of this pressing need.
In contemplating the sublime purpose that has brought
us together on this day, we find ourselves without words
to describe adequately our wonderment at the evidences of
Bahá’u’lláh’s handiwork. We stand too close to the moment to
comprehend the magnitude of what has been so amazingly accomplished. But to ponder the circumstances attending seminal
happenings of the past is to awaken in us all some sense of
appreciation for their wonderful consequences in our time.
The revelation of the Tablet of Carmel, the interment of the
remains of Bahá’u’lláh’s martyred Forerunner in the mausoleum
constructed by the beloved Master, the creation by our dear
Guardian of the Arc on the Hill of God—reflections on just

such historic landmarks illumine our understanding and evoke
gratitude in our hearts.
The journeys that brought you to these sacred precincts
have launched you on spiritual adventures that will be celebrated in times to come as having imparted a new impetus to
the advancement of the Cause. This is the hope and expectation
we cherish. For as you drink deep of the rarefied spirit of the
Holy Shrines and imbibe the guidance that will flow from
the consultations in which you will participate, there can be
no doubt that you will find yourselves endowed with a new
confidence, a new power. With so rich an endowment, how can
your endeavors fail? Most surely, you will bring a rejuvenated
fervor and a reconsecrated effort to the compelling civilizing
tasks you have accepted to perform at this potent juncture in
the evolution of our glorious Faith.
Our supplications are intermingled with yours that the
Blessed Beauty may abundantly confirm you in His service.

To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,

24.3

As we write you this message, the Conference of the
Continental Counsellors approaches a triumphant conclusion.
For eight days the Counsellors from all the continents have
consulted on the next phase of the process of entry by troops.
While they were meeting during the first five days, 849 members
of their Auxiliary Boards from 172 countries were arriving at
the Bahá’í World Centre and paying their respects at the Holy
Shrines in anticipation of the moment when they would all
come together in a series of soul-stirring events: ascent of the
newly built Terraces on Mount Carmel; circumambulation of
the Shrine of the Báb; procession along the Arc path for a visit
to the International Teaching Centre Building; a devotional
ceremony to mark the occupation by the Teaching Centre of its
permanent seat; and subsequent joint consultations concerning
their indispensable role in the Five Year Plan on which the
Bahá’í world will embark at Rid.ván 2001.
The deliberations of the Counsellors themselves have
been the heart of these stupendous activities. Their consultations have been marked by a combination of sobriety and
effervescence that has refined the character of their discussions
and illumined understanding. It is clear from the confident
atmosphere in which they have conferred that their institution
has reached a new stage in its maturation. Even though they
function principally as individuals, the Counsellors across
all Boards have become of one mind. By internalizing and
integrating the lessons and experiences of systematization called
for in the Four Year Plan, they have indeed been transformed
into channels of unified thought. We appreciate that the new
height in the evolution of their institution is a reflection, too,
of the measure to which, with their wise and constant advice,
153

24.1
24.2

24.3

Turning Point

24.4

24.5

24.6

24.7

the Spiritual Assemblies and other institutions of the world
community have evolved.
As the time for the Conference drew near, there were
signs that the Faith had arrived at a point in its development
beyond which a new horizon opens before us. Such intimations
were communicated in our report last Rid.ván of the change in
culture of the Bahá’í community as training institutes emerged,
as the construction projects on Mount Carmel approached
their completion, and as the internal processes of institutional
consolidation and the external processes towards world unity
became more fully synchronized. They were elaborated in the
message we addressed to the Conference of the Continental
Boards of Counsellors a few days ago. But the extraordinary
dynamics at work throughout the Conference crystallized these
indications into a recognizable reality. With a spirit of exultation we are moved to announce to you: the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh
now enters the fifth epoch of its Formative Age.
Recognition of this milestone falls within the patterns
established by Shoghi Effendi for marking measures of time in
the history of the Cause; he foresaw among these a succession
of epochs occurring in the Formative Age. It must fill every
devoted follower of Bahá’u’lláh with joy and wonder that His
Administrative Order has reached so important a point at so
crucial a time, when so many members of the institution of the
Counsellors are gathered in splendid array at the World Centre
of His Faith. They will return to the far corners of the earth as
torches aflame with the spirit of service. That they will pour fresh
energy into their activities, there can be no doubt. Their efforts
will surely widen the path leading to the success of the Twelve
Month Plan, and through that to the launching at ­Ri­d­.­ván of the
five year enterprise that will be the first in a series of Plans to be
pursued until the centenary of the Formative Age.
The Counsellors will leave here anticipating their early
consultations with National Spiritual Assemblies regarding the
operation in their countries of the forthcoming Plan. With the
involvement of their eager auxiliaries, they will assist, too, in
quickly moving the requisite planning process to regional and
local areas of the community in every land.
In the waning moments of these eventful days, our hearts
are turned in humble gratitude to the Ancient Beauty for the
abundance of the blessings He has bestowed. The very earth of
Carmel is astir with the wonders of His grace as she responds
154

24.4

24.5

24.6

24.7

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

to the redemptive call He raised in the Tablet bearing her name.
His fervent wish expressed therein resounds in the souls of His
lovers throughout the planet: “Oh, how I long to announce
unto every spot on the surface of the earth, and to carry to
each one of its cities, the glad-tidings of this Revelation. . . .”
The friends now gathered amid the splendor at Carmel’s heart
have heard it with new ears and have reaffirmed their pledge to
respond to this divine longing. May their exploits in the Name
of Bahá scatter more widely the fragrance of His Revelation,
strengthen more firmly the foundation of His institutions,
and embolden more resolutely the activities of His worldwide
community, impelling forward the process by which troop after
troop will enter into the stronghold of the Ark of Salvation.

Rid.ván 2001
To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
25.1

25.2

25.3

With great joy in our hearts and high expectations, we come
to this Rid.ván season at a change of time, when a new state of
mind is evident among us all. Abroad in our world community
there is a heightened awareness of the value of process, the
necessity of planning and the virtue of systematic action in
fostering growth and in developing the human resources by
which expansion can be sustained and consolidation assured.
The coherence of understanding about these prerequisites of
progress cannot be overvalued, nor can the importance of
perpetuating them through well-ordered training be overestimated. And so the arrival of our community at such a moment
of consciousness is an occasion of significance for us. We are
deeply grateful to the Blessed Beauty to be able to recognize and
acclaim it at the very beginning of the global enterprise being
launched during these festive days.
The power of will generated by this consciousness characterized the conference of the Continental Counsellors and the
members of their Auxiliary Boards who gathered last January
in the Holy Land. The event produced so illuminating an
experience as to signalize the Faith’s entry into a new epoch,
the fifth of its Formative Age. Such a freshness of vitality as
was displayed at this historic gathering came to be understood
as a manifestation of the rising quality of activity throughout
the community. Pursuit during the past year of the essentials
for advancing the process of entry by troops confirmed this
observation. The path was thus paved for the Five Year Plan,
the first venture being entered upon in the Fifth Epoch.
In augmenting major efforts of the previous Four Year
Plan that brought into being more than 300 training institutes,
the Twelve Month Plan achieved its purpose. It gathered
157

25.1

25.2

25.3

Turning Point

25.4

25.5

significance through the notable responses of institutions
and individuals to the call for a greater focus on the spiritual
nurturing of children and the involvement of junior youth in
Bahá’í community life. The training of teachers of children’s
classes and the inclusion of junior youth in the institute process
have become a regular part of Bahá’í activity in a number of
countries. Despite its brevity, the Twelve Month Plan had an
importance beyond the objectives specifically assigned. The
Plan was a dynamic link between a highly eventful epoch in
Bahá’í history and the immensely promising prospects of a
new one, for which its achievements have so well prepared
the community. It has been etched in our annals, too, for
the enduring effects of the Faith’s activities at the end of the
twentieth century—a century that deserves to be reflected upon
by any Bahá’í who wishes to understand the tumultuous forces
that influenced the life of the planet and the processes of the
Cause itself at a crucial time in humanity’s social and spiritual
evolution. As an aid to so worthy an effort, Century of Light,
a review of the twentieth century, was prepared at our request
and under our supervision.
On many occasions during this one-year endeavor, the
external affairs activities of the Faith were especially visible.
Consider, for example, the instances of Bahá’í representatives’
having participated prominently in the millennial events that
took place in May, August and September at the urging of the
Secretary-General of the United Nations. The implications
of so close and conspicuous an involvement of the Bahá’í
International Community with the processes of the Lesser Peace
will require the passage of time to be properly understood.
Among other highlights was the continental colloquium organized in India by the Institute for Studies in Global Prosperity, a
new agency operating under the aegis of the Bahá’í International
Community. Adopting the theme of “science, religion and
development,” the conference featured the participation of
leading nongovernmental organizations of India, as well as that
of institutions of such renown as UNESCO, UNICEF, WHO and the
World Bank. In October, the Bahá’í World News Service (BWNS)
was launched on the Internet with the intention of reaching
both Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í audiences with news stories about
developments throughout the Bahá’í world.
The intensive activities at the Bahá’í World Centre during
the last year were, for the most part, made known to the
158

25.4

25.5

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

25.6

25.7

friends through previous reports that included references to
such achievements as the occupation by the International
Teaching Centre of its permanent seat on Mount Carmel; the
Conference of Continental Counsellors and the members of
their Auxiliary Boards held in the Holy Land last January; and
the completion of the Mount Carmel projects, which are now
receiving finishing touches in preparation for the celebratory
events in May. Last October, for the first time, pilgrims and
visitors were received at the new Reception Centre in Haifa,
which became fully operational. At Bahjí the embellishment
of the sacred site through the development of its gardens
has proceeded continually; the effort has, however, received
a boost from the new project initiated last year to construct
a Visitors’ Centre towards the northern end of the property
beyond the Collins Gate. Scheduled for completion in the
next few months, the structure is fully in place, and work is
progressing in all areas, including finishing and landscaping.
The new facilities will improve the ability of the World Centre
to receive increasing numbers of pilgrims, short-term Bahá’í
visitors, and special guests.
To conclude this summary of the year, we rejoice in
informing you that, after the lapse of almost three decades,
the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Indonesia
was restored at the National Convention held in Jakarta last
­Rid­.­ván. A ban imposed on Bahá’í activities in August 1962
severely restricted the actions of the Indonesian Bahá’ís for
all that time, but they remained steadfast and wise in their
long-suffering until changed circumstances in that country
resulted in the lifting of the ban. May we not venture to hope,
then, that a similar happy report concerning our beleaguered
co-religionists in Iran, Egypt and other countries will not be
too far distant?
Dear Friends: Two decades from now the Bahá’í world will
celebrate the centenary of the inception of the Formative Age.
We look back at the dawning of the Age from the vantage point
of attainments that could hardly have been imagined at the
outset. Up ahead are horizons that urgently summon the community to even greater achievements in the short span separating
it from that centennial. Those heights can and must be scaled.
The Five Year Plan, to which we call the urgent and sustained attention of the friends throughout the world, is intended to meet
this challenge. It constitutes the first of a series of campaigns
159

25.6

25.7

Turning Point

25.8

25.9

that will be pursued during these twenty years. This Plan marks
the next phase in the aim to accomplish a significant advance
in the process of entry by troops. It demands an acceleration of
this vital process and, furthermore, insists upon continuity in
systematic endeavor on the part of its three constituent participants: the individual, the institutions, and the community.
No need to elaborate on the requirements of the Plan,
for these were set out in our message to the assembled
Counsellors in the Holy Land and subsequently shared with
all National Spiritual Assemblies. Soon after their conference,
the Counsellors began consulting with the National Assemblies
about the execution of the Plan in their respective jurisdictions. The Plan’s direction is therefore known to the friends
everywhere, as regional and local preparations for pursuing
its major aim are under way. There is a general awareness by
now that efforts will be made to effect a deeper penetration
of the Faith into more and more regions within countries. For
example, where circumstances permit, local communities that
exist in close proximity to each other will be mobilized to participate in intensive programs of growth. Other approaches will
require methodical opening of new areas for which homefront
pioneers must be raised up in the same consecrated spirit that
prompted those who scattered abroad at earlier times to open
virgin territories across continents and seas. Suffice it to say
that the process animating this divinely driven enterprise will
eventually expand as related features are gradually introduced
and systematically integrated into its operation.
A feature of the Fifth Epoch will be the enrichment of
the devotional life of the community through the raising up
of national Houses of Worship, as circumstances in national
communities permit. The scheduling of these projects will be
determined by the Universal House of Justice in relation to
the advancement of the process of entry by troops within
countries. This development will unfold throughout successive
stages of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan. Upon the completion
of the Mother Temple of the West, the Guardian started a
program of constructing continental temples. The first among
these were the Mashriqu’l-Adhkárs in Kampala, Sydney and
Frankfurt, which were built in response to Ten Year Plan goals.
The Universal House of Justice continued along these lines with
the building of Temples in Panama City, Apia, and New Delhi.
But this continental stage has yet to be completed: one more

edifice remains to be built. It is with profound thankfulness and
joy that we announce at this auspicious moment the decision
to proceed with this last project. During the Five Year Plan,
erection of the Mother Temple of South America in Santiago,
Chile, will commence and thus fulfill a wish clearly expressed
by Shoghi Effendi.
Meanwhile, the time is propitious that further steps
be taken at the World Centre to develop the functions of
the institutions occupying the new edifices on the Arc. The
International Teaching Centre having advanced significantly in
its work, attention will be given particularly to organizing the
work of the Centre for the Study of the Texts. Enriching the
translations into English from the Holy Texts will be a special
object of this attention. The purpose of the institution is to
assist the Universal House of Justice in consulting the Sacred
Writings and to prepare translations and commentaries on the
authoritative texts of the Faith. Moreover, in the Holy Land,
a continued effort will be devoted towards the devising of
measures to make possible a further increase in the number of
pilgrims and visitors to the Bahá’í World Centre.
In our Rid.ván message five years ago, we announced the
holding of a major event at the World Centre to mark the
completion of the projects on Mount Carmel and the opening
of the Terraces of the Shrine of the Báb to the public. The moment is upon us, and we exult in the anticipation of welcoming
friends from virtually all countries to programs that will extend
over a five-day period, 21-25 May. We are also happy to say
that steps are being taken to connect the Bahá’í world to the
proceedings through live transmissions on the World Wide Web
and by satellite, about which information is being provided.
As the World Centre focuses on the preparations, excitement
is building up among the public in Haifa, where municipal
authorities have undertaken to publish a book entitled Bahá’í
Shrine and Gardens on Mount Carmel, Haifa, Israel: A Visual
Journey to coincide with the event. Moreover, the Israel Postal
Authority is pursuing its decision to release at the same time a
commemorative stamp featuring the Terraces. The significance
of the occasion lies principally in the pause it will allow for a
review of the remarkable distance the Cause has covered in
its development during the twentieth century. It will be time,
too, for considering the future implications of the phenomenal
accomplishments symbolized by the rise of the monumental

structures on God’s holy mountain—a rise that opens the
spiritual and administrative centers of our Faith to the gaze of
the world.
As our community rejoices in these thrilling considerations,
let every member bear in mind that there is no time for resting
on laurels. Humanity’s current plight is too desperate to allow
for even a moment’s hesitation in sharing the Bread of Life,
which has come down from heaven in our time. Let there be
no delay, then, in advancing the process that has every promise
of success in ushering to the banquet table of the Lord of Hosts
the souls of all that hunger after truth.
May He Who keeps watch over the destiny of His divine
System guide and direct and confirm every effort you make
towards the realization of the urgent tasks set before you.

To the Believers Gathered for the Events Marking the
Completion of the Projects on Mount Carmel
Dear Bahá’í Friends,
26.1

One hundred and forty-eight years have passed since the
moment in the darkness of the Síyáh-Chál when Bahá’u’lláh
received the Divine summons to rise and proclaim to all on
earth the dawning of the Day of God:

26.1

26.2

Verily, We shall render Thee victorious by Thyself and by
Thy pen. . . . Erelong God will raise up the treasures of the
earth—men who will aid Thee through Thyself and through
Thy Name, wherewith God hath revived the hearts of such
as have recognized Him.

26.2

26.3

In terms of historical time, it is but the briefest of spaces
that separates that primal moment from the splendid victory
we celebrate here this week. You who have come together from
every corner of the earth and from every segment of the human
family represent a cross-section of those whom Bahá’u’lláh has
raised up to aid Him, and no one among us can hope to express
adequately the gratitude we feel at being in that company.
The majestic buildings that now stand along the Arc traced
for them by Shoghi Effendi on the slope of the Mountain of
God, together with the magnificent flight of garden terraces that
embrace the Shrine of the Báb, are an outward expression of
the immense power animating the Cause we serve. They offer
timeless witness to the fact that the followers of Bahá’u’lláh
have successfully laid the foundations of a worldwide community transcending all differences that divide the human race,
and have brought into existence the principal institutions of a
unique and unassailable Administrative Order that shapes this
community’s life. In the transformation that has taken place
on Mount Carmel, the Bahá’í Cause emerges as a visible and

26.3

26.4

163

26.4

Turning Point

26.5

26.6

26.7

compelling reality on the global stage, as the focal center of
forces that will, in God’s good time, bring about the reconstruction of society, and as a mystic source of spiritual renewal for
all who turn to it.
Reflection on what the Bahá’í community has accomplished
throws into heartbreaking perspective the suffering and
deprivation engulfing the great majority of our fellow human
beings. It is necessary that it should do so, because the effect is
to open our minds and souls to vital implications of the mission Bahá’u’lláh has laid on us. “Know thou of a truth,” He
declares, “these great oppressions that have befallen the world
are preparing it for the advent of the Most Great Justice.”
“God be praised!” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá adds, “The sun of justice hath
risen above the horizon of Bahá’u’lláh. For in His Tablets the
foundations of such a justice have been laid as no mind hath,
from the beginning of creation, conceived.” In the final analysis, it is this Divine purpose that all our activities are intended
to serve, and we will advance this purpose to the degree that
we understand what is at stake in the efforts we are making to
teach the Faith, to establish and consolidate its institutions, and
to intensify the influence it is exerting in the life of society.
Humanity’s crying need will not be met by a struggle among
competing ambitions or by protest against one or another of
the countless wrongs afflicting a desperate age. It calls, rather,
for a fundamental change of consciousness, for a wholehearted
embrace of Bahá’u’lláh’s teaching that the time has come when
each human being on earth must learn to accept responsibility
for the welfare of the entire human family. Commitment to this
revolutionizing principle will increasingly empower individual
believers and Bahá’í institutions alike in awakening others to
the Day of God and to the latent spiritual and moral capacities
that can change this world into another world. We demonstrate
this commitment, Shoghi Effendi tells us, by our rectitude of
conduct towards others, by the discipline of our own natures,
and by our complete freedom from the prejudices that cripple
collective action in the society around us and frustrate positive
impulses towards change.
The standards set out by the Guardian apply to the entire
Bahá’í community, both in its collective life and in the lives of
its individual members. They hold, however, particular implications for Bahá’í youth, who are blessed with the enviable
advantages of high energy, flexibility of mind and, to a great
164

26.5

26.6

26.7

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

26.8

26.9

26.10

extent, freedom of movement. The world that Bahá’í youth
are inheriting is one in which the distribution of educational,
economic and other basic opportunities is grossly unjust. Bahá’í
youth must not be daunted by such barriers. Their challenge
is to understand the real condition of humanity and to forge
among themselves enduring spiritual bonds that free them not
only from racial and national divisions but also from those
created by social and material conditions, and that will fit them
to carry forward the great trust reposed in them.
Bahá’u’lláh encourages us to anticipate from the youth
of His community a much earlier advance to maturity than is
characteristic of the rest of society. Clearly, that does not in
any way diminish the importance of the pursuit of education,
of economic realities, or of family obligations. It does mean
that Bahá’í youth can accept—and should be encouraged to
accept—a responsibility of their own for moral leadership in
the transformation of society. In vindication of these words,
we invoke the memory of the One Whose Shrine has today set
the Mountain of God ablaze with light, and the memory of the
band of youthful heroes and heroines whose greatness of soul
and sacrifice of self launched on its course the enterprise in
which we are engaged.
The achievement we are today celebrating brings into
focus two paradoxical realities. Within the Faith itself, the
gathering strength of the Bahá’í community presages a great
surge forward, intimations of which are already everywhere apparent. Inevitably, as Shoghi Effendi several times emphasized,
this advance will excite even more intense opposition than
the Cause has so far encountered, opposition that will in turn
release the greater forces needed for the still more demanding
tasks that lie ahead.
The world in which our efforts are taking place is likewise
undergoing profound changes. On the one hand, the vast
network of agencies and individuals that promote understanding and cooperation among diverse peoples affirms ever more
powerfully the growing recognition that the “earth is but one
country, and mankind its citizens.” On the other hand, it is
equally clear that the world is moving through a period of
social paralysis, tyranny and anarchy, a period marked by the
widespread neglect of both governmental and personal responsibility, the ultimate consequences of which no one on earth can
foresee. The effect of both developments, as Shoghi Effendi also
165

26.8

26.9

26.10

Turning Point

26.11

26.12

26.13

pointed out, will be to awaken in the hearts of those who share
this planet with us a longing for unity and justice that can be
met only by the Cause of God.
A long and arduous process of struggle, experimentation
and construction has led to the victories that lift our hearts as
a new century opens. Through the rapidly proliferating system
of institutes and the energy being invested everywhere in area
growth strategies, the Bahá’í community has moved swiftly to
capitalize on what has been achieved. However deep may be
the gloom enveloping the world, the future has never looked
so bright for the prosecution of Bahá’u’lláh’s mission. We who
have been privileged to gather here this week have witnessed,
with our own eyes, the dawning fulfillment of the words
revealed by the Lord of Hosts on this mountain over a century
ago, words which cause the very atoms of the earth to vibrate:
“Verily this is the Day in which both land and sea rejoice at
this announcement, the Day for which have been laid up those
things which God, through a bounty beyond the ken of mortal
mind or heart, hath destined for revelation.”
Such a privilege carries with it an equally great responsibility, the responsibility to do our part, whatever the sacrifice,
whatever the difficulty, to see that the poignant desire expressed
by Bahá’u’lláh on that historic occasion is fulfilled: “Oh, how
I long to announce unto every spot on the surface of the earth,
and to carry to each one of its cities, the glad-tidings of this
Revelation—a Revelation to which the heart of Sinai hath
been attracted, and in whose name the Burning Bush is calling:
‘Unto God, the Lord of Lords, belong the kingdoms of earth
and heaven.’”
With all the fervor of thankful hearts, we will pray at the
Holy Threshold that Bahá’u’lláh will bless and confirm every
effort you make to advance His purpose for the redemption of
humankind and the healing of its ills.

To the Friends Gathered at the Eighth ASEAN
Youth Conference in Thailand
Dear Bahá’í Friends,
27.1
27.2

27.3

We send our loving greetings to all those gathered at the
Eighth ASEAN Youth Conference.
The Five Year Plan, which will undoubtedly be the focus of
your consultations over the next few days, requires concentrated
and sustained attention to two essential movements. The first
is the steady flow of believers through the sequence of courses
offered by training institutes, for the purpose of developing the
human resources of the Cause. The second, which receives its
impetus from the first, is the movement of geographic clusters
from one stage of growth to the next. That Bahá’í youth must
be intensely involved in both of these—indeed, that they must
be a driving force behind them—goes without saying. We urge
you, then, to cast your deliberations in the framework of these
two pressing requirements. Ask yourselves how, as individuals,
as members of your local and national communities, and as
the vanguard of an entire generation in your region, you can
ensure that the advancement in the process of entry by troops,
called for by the Five Year Plan, is achieved in each of your
countries.
We shall remember you in our prayers in the Holy Shrines.

To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dear Bahá’í Friends,
28.1

28.2

In the months since the launching of the Five Year Plan,
national communities have adopted measures that are giving
a dynamic thrust and added coherence to their activities. By
now, in most countries the National Spiritual Assembly, or its
Regional Councils, will have surveyed the territory under its
jurisdiction and divided it into small geographic clusters, in
keeping with the criteria set forth in our letter dated 9 January
2001. These clusters are being categorized according to their
current stage of development, and plans of action devised to
promote in them growth from one stage to the next. We could
not be more gratified by the eager response of the institutions
everywhere to the requirements of the Five Year Plan.
The clearly defined plans now in place multiply teaching opportunities for those wishing to serve the Faith in the
international field as short- or long-term pioneers. Most of the
needs of the clusters in a given country should increasingly be
met by homefront pioneers as the Plan unfolds. But, given the
sheer number of geographic areas which require systematic
attention in order to advance, international pioneers will have
a notable role to play. Their participation will be especially
effective in the programs of growth spreading throughout the
world if they have developed abilities to foster the institute
process. Beyond this, international pioneers and traveling
teachers can contribute significantly to the work of the Faith
in such spheres of activity as administration, proclamation,
and social and economic development. A document has been
prepared by the International Teaching Centre which briefly
describes the conditions of national Bahá’í communities and
the endeavors that could benefit from outside assistance. It will

169

28.1

28.2

Turning Point

28.3

28.4

soon be available to you through National Spiritual Assemblies
and the Counsellors and their auxiliaries.
The movement of pioneers and traveling teachers from
one place to another is an indispensable feature of the Bahá’í
community. In the Twelve Month Plan alone, over 1,800
believers from nearly 90 countries set out to serve the Faith in
the international field. Apart from the services such staunch
souls are able to render to the Cause of God, this intermingling
of the peoples of the world is vital to the patterns of life that
the followers of Bahá’u’lláh are striving to establish and which
are destined to provide an example for the rest of humanity to
emulate. As the Bahá’í community continues to grow in capacity, it should give increasing attention to bringing together the
diverse members of the human race in ever closer association.
At this important juncture in the development of the Faith,
when the systematization of the teaching work is gaining
momentum in all parts of the globe and integrating forces are
propelling society towards Bahá’u’lláh’s design, every faithful
servant of the Cause must be galvanized by the vision of splendid accomplishments ahead. We call upon you to consider your
circumstances, examine the conditions of various countries,
determine where you can best serve the needs of the Faith,
and take resolute action. Let those who long to partake of the
joy of such meritorious service go forth well assured that our
prayers will accompany them, and fully expectant of Divine
confirmations.

Rid.ván 2002
To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
29.1

29.2

29.3

The onrush of happenings within and without the Faith at
the beginning of the Fifth Epoch of the Formative Age presents
a spectacle that is awe-inspiring. Inside the Cause, the historic
importance of the events last May that marked the completion
of the edifices on Mount Carmel dazzled the senses as their
impact was instantly communicated throughout the planet by
satellite broadcasts and by the most extensive media coverage
ever accorded a Bahá’í occasion. As the latest evidences in the
tangible unfolding of the Tablet of Carmel were laid bare in
breathtaking splendor before the eyes of the world, the Cause
of Bahá’u’lláh leapt to new prominence in its continuing rise
from obscurity. An indelible impression was thus registered in
the annals of the Dispensation.
This outward manifestation of the vitality animating our
irrepressible Faith has had its counterpart in the thrust of the
internal processes at work since the inception last Rid.ván of the
Five Year Plan. We are therefore moved to invite the delegates
assembled at National Conventions and all other followers of
Bahá’u’lláh throughout the world to join us in reflecting on a
few potent highlights of the operation of the Plan during its
first year—highlights that cannot but rejoice hearts and inspire
confidence in the incalculable potentialities of the course on
which the Plan is set.
In their eager response to its requirements, National
Spiritual Assemblies engaged in a series of planning sessions
with Continental Counsellors before and immediately after
Rid.ván. These set the pace for a vigorous launching distinguished by the steps taken to effectuate a new feature of the
process of entry by troops. In each national community, Bahá’í
institutions began the task of systematically mapping their
171

29.1

29.2

29.3

Turning Point

29.4

29.5

country with the aim of sectioning it into clusters, each one
being of a composition and size consonant with a scale of
activities for growth and development that is manageable. Such
a mapping, as has already been reported by some 150 countries,
makes it possible to realize a pattern of well-ordered expansion
and consolidation. Thus it creates as well a perspective, or
vision, of systematic growth that can be sustained from cluster
to cluster across an entire country. With this perspective, virgin
clusters, like virgin territories identified in past campaigns,
become goals for homefront pioneers, while opened clusters
focus on their internal development mobilized by the mutually
reinforcing work of the three constituent components of the
Plan: the individual, the institutions and the community.
It is most encouraging to see that the progress of this work
is being energized through the training institute process, which
was considerably strengthened last year by the campaigns
undertaken in many countries to increase the number of
trained tutors. Where a training institute is well established and
constantly functioning, three core activities—study circles, devotional meetings, and children’s classes—have multiplied with
relative ease. Indeed, the increasing participation of seekers in
these activities, at the invitation of their Bahá’í friends, has lent
a new dimension to their purposes, consequently effecting new
enrollments. Here, surely, is a direction of great promise for
the teaching work. These core activities, which at the outset
were devised principally to benefit the believers themselves, are
naturally becoming portals for entry by troops. By combining
study circles, devotional meetings and children’s classes within
the framework of clusters, a model of coherence in lines of
action has been put in place and is already producing welcome
results. Worldwide application of this model, we feel confident,
holds immense possibilities for the progress of the Cause in the
years ahead.
These thrilling prospects were made the more viable
by the enormous energy the International Teaching Centre
invested in enriching the world community’s understanding of
systematic growth. Seizing the advantage afforded by the recent
commencement of a new term of service for Auxiliary Board
members, the Teaching Centre called for 16 regional orientation
conferences to be held during the closing months of the year. To
each of these it dispatched two of its members. In giving much
focus to the theme “training institutes and systematic growth,”
172

29.4

29.5

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

29.6

29.7

29.8

the conferences, attended by all but a few of the Board members
throughout the world, provided the participants with a wealth
of information that will, through their tireless labors, suffuse
the entire fabric of the community.
A community so richly endowed, so experienced, so focused
on a divinely-inspired plan of action looks outward to a world
whose inhabitants have, since the May 2001 events in the Holy
Land, sunk more deeply into a slough of multiple disorders.
And yet it is precisely under these seemingly inhospitable
conditions that the Cause is meant to advance, and will thrive.
The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, the newly released volume
containing English translations of the full texts of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Tablets to the kings and rulers of the world, has come as a
propitious reminder of the dire consequences of ignoring His
warnings against injustice, tyranny and corruption. The violent
shocks being inflicted on the consciousness of people everywhere emphasize the urgency of the remedy He has prescribed.
We, the scattered bands of His loyal servants, have thus come
again to a time of irresistible opportunities—opportunities to
teach His Cause, to build up His wondrous System, to provide
sacrificially the urgently needed material means on which
the progress and execution of spiritual activities inevitably
depend.
Our inescapable task is to exploit the current turmoil,
without fear or hesitation, for the purpose of spreading and
demonstrating the transformational virtue of the one Message
that can secure the peace of the world. Has the Blessed Beauty
not empowered and reassured us with potent words? “Let not
the happenings of the world sadden you” is His loving counsel.
“I swear by God,” He continues; “The sea of joy yearneth to
attain your presence, for every good thing hath been created for
you, and will, according to the needs of the times, be revealed
unto you.”
Unhampered by any doubts, unhindered by any obstacles,
press on, then, with the Plan in hand.

To the Bahá’ís of the World†
Dearly loved Friends,
30.1

30.2

We have followed, with immense gratitude to Bahá’u’lláh,
the unfoldment of the Five Year Plan in the two years since
our message of 9 January 2001 to the Conference of the
Continental Boards of Counsellors. It is heartening, indeed, to
see the culture of learning that is taking root everywhere, as the
Bahá’í world community focuses on advancing the process of
entry by troops. At this juncture, when the collective experience
of the community has taken so significant a step forward, we
think it timely to review with you the insights thus far gained
and to clarify issues that have arisen.
During the initial months of the Plan, National Spiritual
Assemblies proceeded with relative ease to divide the territories
under their jurisdiction into areas consisting of adjacent localities, called clusters, using criteria that were purely geographic
and social and did not relate to the strength of local Bahá’í
communities. Reports received at the World Centre indicate
† A cover letter to this message, dated 17 January 2003 to all
National Spiritual Assemblies written on behalf of the Universal
House of Justice stated: “The Bahá’í world community has made
significant strides since the launching of the Plan, and the House
of Justice is conscious of the role that the institutions of the Faith
have played in keeping the friends focused on the vital work
before them. It hopes that the attached message will offer them
an exciting vision of the future unfoldment of the Plan and the
tasks they are being called upon to accomplish. That through
your wise leadership their efforts will reach the level of intensity
required to bring about and sustain accelerated expansion and
consolidation is the object of its most fervent prayers at the
Sacred Threshold.”

that there are now close to 17,000 clusters worldwide, excluding those countries where, for one reason or another, the
operation of the Faith is restricted. The number of clusters per
country varies widely—from India with its 1,580 to Singapore,
which necessarily sees itself as one cluster. Some of the groupings are sparsely populated areas with only a few thousand
inhabitants, while the boundaries of others encompass several
million people. For the most part, large urban centers under
the jurisdiction of one Local Spiritual Assembly have been designated single clusters, these in turn being divided into sectors,
so as to facilitate planning and implementation.
With the various countries and territories divided into manageable areas, national communities moved quickly ahead to
categorize clusters according to the stages of the ­development
of the Faith mentioned in our 9 January message. The exercise
afforded a realistic means for viewing the prospects of the
community, but the task of refining the criteria needed for valid
assessments is proving to be an ongoing challenge to institutions. To assign a cluster to one or another category is not to
make a statement about status. Rather, it is a way of evaluating
its capacity for growth, in order that an approach compatible
with its evolving development can be adopted. Rigid criteria
are obviously counterproductive, but a well-defined scheme to
carry out evaluation is essential. Two criteria seem especially
important: the strength of the human resources raised up by
the training institute for the expansion and consolidation of
the Faith in the cluster, and the ability of the institutions to
mobilize these resources in the field of service.
Focus in almost every country has now turned to stimulating the movement of its priority clusters from their current stage
of growth to the next. What has become strikingly clear is that
progress in this respect depends largely on the efficacy of the
parallel process aimed at helping an ever-increasing number of
friends to move through the main sequence of courses offered
by the institute serving the area. The rise in activity around the
world testifies to the success of these courses in evoking the
spirit of enterprise required to carry out the divers actions that
growth in a cluster, at whatever stage, demands.
Particularly heartwarming to observe is a growing sense of
initiative and resourcefulness throughout the Bahá’í world, along
with courage and audacity. Consecration, zeal, confidence and
tenacity—these are among the qualities that are distinguishing
176

the believers in every continent. They are exemplified by, but are
certainly not limited to, those who are arising to pioneer on the
home front. As we had hoped, goals for the opening of virgin
clusters are being readily met by enthusiastic participants of
institute programs who, equipped with the knowledge and skills
acquired through training courses, set out to establish the Faith
in a new area and bring a fledgling community into being.
In most clusters, movement from one stage of growth to
the next is being defined in terms of the multiplication of study
circles, devotional meetings and children’s classes, and the
expansion they engender. Devotional meetings begin to flourish
as consciousness of the spiritual dimension of human existence
is raised among the believers in an area through institute
courses. Children’s classes, too, are a natural outgrowth of the
training received early in the study of the main sequence. As
both ­activities are made open to the wider community through
a variety of well-conceived and imaginative means, they attract
a growing number of seekers, who, more often than not, are
eager to attend firesides and join study circles. Many go on
subsequently to declare their faith in Bahá’u’lláh and, from
the outset, view their role in the community as that of active
participants in a dynamic process of growth. Individual and
collective exertions in the teaching field intensify correspondingly, further fuelling the process. Established communities are
revitalized, and newly formed ones soon gain the privilege of
electing their Local Spiritual Assemblies.
The coherence thus achieved through the establishment
of study circles, devotional meetings and children’s classes
provides the initial impulse for growth in a cluster, an impulse
that gathers strength as these core activities multiply in number.
Campaigns that help a sizeable group of believers advance far
enough in the main sequence of courses to perform the necessary
acts of service lend impetus to this multiplication of activity.
It is evident, then, that a systematic approach to training
has created a way for Bahá’ís to reach out to the surrounding society, share Bahá’u’lláh’s message with friends, family,
neighbours and coworkers, and expose them to the richness
of His teachings. This outward-looking orientation is one of
the finest fruits of the grassroots learning taking place. The
pattern of activity that is being established in clusters around
the globe constitutes a proven means of accelerating expansion
and consolidation. Yet this is only a beginning.

In many parts of the world, bringing large numbers into
the ranks of Bahá’u’lláh’s followers has traditionally not been a
formidable task. It is therefore encouraging to see that, in some
of the more developed clusters, carefully designed projects are
being added to the existing pattern of growth to reach receptive
populations and lift the rate of expansion to a higher level.
Such projects accelerate the tempo of teaching, already on the
rise through the efforts of individuals. And, where large-scale
enrollment is beginning to result, provision is being made to
ensure that a certain percentage of the new believers immediately enter the institute program, for, as we have emphasized in
several messages, these friends will be called upon to serve the
needs of an ever-growing Bahá’í population. They help deepen
the generality of the Bahá’ís by visiting them regularly; they
teach children, arrange devotional meetings and form study
circles, making it possible to sustain expansion.
All of this opens thrilling opportunities for Local Spiritual
Assemblies. Theirs is the challenge, in collaboration with the
Auxiliary Board members who counsel and assist them, to
utilize the energies and talents of the swelling human resources
available in their respective areas of jurisdiction both to create
a vibrant community life and to begin influencing the society
around them. In localities where Spiritual Assemblies do not
exist or are not yet functioning at the necessary level, a stepby-step approach to the development of communities and Local
Spiritual Assemblies is showing excellent promise.
It is especially gratifying to note the high degree of participation of believers in the various aspects of the growth process. In
cluster after cluster, the number of those shouldering the responsibilities of expansion and consolidation is steadily increasing.
Meetings of consultation held at the cluster level serve to raise
awareness of possibilities and generate enthusiasm. Here, free
from the demands of formal decision-making, participants
reflect on experience gained, share insights, explore approaches
and acquire a better understanding of how each can contribute
to achieving the aim of the Plan. In many cases, such interaction
leads to consensus on a set of short-term goals, both individual
and collective. Learning in action is becoming the outstanding
feature of the emerging mode of operation.
Let there be no doubt that what we are witnessing is the
gathering momentum of that process of the entry of humanity
into the Cause by troops, foreshadowed in Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet

to the King of Persia, eagerly anticipated by the Master, and
described by the Guardian as the necessary prelude to mass
conversion. In the vanguard of the process are those clusters
which, although still relatively few in number, are now ready
to launch intensive programs of growth. The scale of expansion
that is to mark the next stage of growth in these clusters calls
for an intensity of effort yet to be achieved. May the prodigious
output of energy devoted to this mighty undertaking be reinforced by the power of Divine assistance.
Be assured of our heartfelt prayers in the Holy Shrines that
Bahá’u’lláh may bless and confirm your endeavors to realize,
to the fullest, the extraordinary opportunities of these precious
days.

To the Friends Gathered at the Series of Youth Forums
Called by the Regional Bahá’í Council
of the Western States, U.S.A.
Dear Bahá’í Friends,
31.1

31.2

We were delighted to learn that the Regional Bahá’í Council
of the Western States has called upon selected Local Spiritual
Assemblies to conduct a series of youth forums at this juncture
in the unfoldment of the Five Year Plan. The Council is clearly
conscious of the weighty responsibilities with which it has
been entrusted and recognizes that the success of the efforts
to advance the process of entry by troops across the region
will depend, in no small measure, on your wholehearted and
sacrificial participation in the plans of action now in place. We
applaud the Council’s decision and urge you to take advantage
of the opportunity to contribute to the progress of the Cause
in your communities.
From your study of our 17 January 2003 message to the
Bahá’ís of the world, you know that the challenge facing
the institutions of the Faith in every part of the globe is to
stimulate the movement of the clusters in their respective areas
of jurisdiction from one stage of growth to the next. You are
also well aware that this movement receives its impetus from
another, that is, from the steady flow of believers through the
sequence of courses adopted by their training institutes. In
those clusters where the institute process is well established,
three key activities—study circles, devotional meetings and
children’s classes—tend to multiply with relative ease, creating
an initial pattern of growth, to which other elements must then
be added. Multiplying these activities ranks high among the
priorities of the institutions everywhere, and you should not
underestimate the importance of the part Bahá’í youth must
play in this mighty endeavor. Who more than the young people
181

31.1

31.2

Turning Point

31.3

31.4

of our communities can lend the collective energy needed to
achieve so necessary an increase in the level of activity?
We hope, then, that you will become the most enthusiastic
participants in the programs of growth in your clusters. You
should take up with a true sense of responsibility, and in a
spirit of joy that service to the Faith evokes, the task of rapidly
increasing the number of study circles, devotional meetings and
children’s classes in the Western States. Your efforts to meet this
challenge will be greatly enhanced if you constantly seek out
receptive souls in your schools, at your universities, and in the
workplace and invite them to join you in your systematic study
of institute courses.
Now more than ever you should be attuned to the interests
of your peers and be confident that many will welcome the opportunity to delve into the Writings with you. The widespread
turmoil in the world, so graphically displayed by ongoing
occurrences, brings with it a heightened degree of receptivity to
the Cause, especially among young people. You should remain
ever conscious of the forces at work in society and seize on
the opening they provide for you to extend the influence of
the Faith. Your peers long to make sense of the events they see
unfolding around them, both at home and on the global scene.
You alone have the Message that can soothe their troubled
hearts and provide them with the clarity of thought they desire.
Be assured of our prayers at the Sacred Threshold on your
behalf.

Dearly loved Friends,

32.3

As the Five Year Plan enters upon its third year, momentum
is building: the record of achievement during the year just ended
far outdistanced that of the previous twelve months. The thrust
of this momentum owes as much to the increased coherence
achieved in the Plan’s constituent elements as to the animating
effect of the spirit of unrest pervading the planet.
The circumstances attending the opening of this new administrative year are at once critical, challenging and extraordinary in their significance. The entire course of the previous
year was agitated by a succession of crises that culminated in
the outbreak of war in the Middle East. The implications are
no less significant for the progress of the community of the
Most Great Name than for the evolution of an increasingly
global society in the throes of a turbulent transition. Of necessity, the timing, scale and tendencies of this transition have
not been predictable. How swift indeed has been the current
change in the tide of world conditions! In the resultant conflict,
involving so conspicuously the countries in which the earliest
history of the Cause took shape, we see a fresh reminder of
Bahá’u’lláh’s warning that the “world’s equilibrium hath been
upset through the vibrating influence of this most great, this
new World Order.” That the events of this crisis directly affect
a territory with as rich a Bahá’í legacy as Iraq is particularly
noteworthy.
The disruptions caused by this and other situations in the
world have, in one instance, suggested the opening of a new
chapter in the history of the highly prized but woefully oppressed Bahá’í community of a land in which the Manifestation
of God for this Day resided for a whole decade. In another,
they have dashed the preparations for the Ninth International

Convention at the World Centre of our Faith. But, however
disappointing, this calls for no dismay. When the Major Plan of
God interferes with His Minor Plan, there should be no doubt
that in due course a way will providentially be opened to an
opportunity of stellar possibilities for advancing the interests
of His glorious Cause.
The sorrows, fears and perplexities evoked by this latest
conflict in the unfoldment of the Lesser Peace have intensified
the feelings of grievance and outrage at the recurrent crises
agitating the planet. The anxieties of people across the globe
are even now being played out publicly in angry demonstrations
too overwhelming to be ignored. The issues they protest and
the emotions they arouse often add to the chaos and confusion
they hope by such public displays to resolve. For the friends of
God, there is an unambiguous explanation for what is occurring; they have only to recall the vision and principles offered
by the Faith if they are to respond effectively to the challenges
posed by the spread of distress and dismay. Let them strive
to understand more deeply the Teachings that are relevant by
reviewing letters of Shoghi Effendi which have been published
in The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, particularly those entitled
“The Goal of a New World Order,” “America and the Most
Great Peace,” and “The Unfoldment of World Civilization.”
While the world continues on its tumultuous course, the
Five Year Plan has reached the operational capacity to enable our community to make giant strides towards its major
aim of advancing the process of entry by troops. The details
of so encouraging a state of affairs for the Faith on all five
continents have already been given in our 17 January letter;
to it we invite your further study. Only a few key details need
now be underscored: The division of countries into clusters
has been completed in 179 of them; there exist some 17,000 of
these seedbeds of expansion. Reflection meetings at the level of
clusters have become a powerful means of unifying thought and
action across institutions and localities; they have lent a potent
stimulus to institutional and individual initiatives in a mutually
supportive spirit. The institute process has demonstrated even
more prominently than before its influence as a generating
force for expansion and consolidation. The core activities of
the Plan have attained a scale far outstripping that of the past
year. As a result, a growing number of friends are now active
in the teaching and administrative work throughout the world,
184

32.4

32.5

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

32.6

32.7

demonstrating the infectious spirit of confidence inspiring the
enthusiasm of their efforts. Youth and children have been more
systematically involved in the programs of the community, and
non-Bahá’ís have been participating more numerously in study
circles, devotional meetings and children’s classes. It is indeed
heartening to note that, in the brief period since the beginning
of the Plan, where in many communities these three core
activities had been sporadic they have become regular features
and have multiplied. Here, then, is a snapshot of a world community focused and on the move as never before.
During the past year, as this pattern of growth became more
firmly rooted in the operation of the Plan, other important
developments were taking place. In the arena of external affairs, agencies of the Bahá’í International Community engaged
in activities too numerous and varied to describe here, but
of a collective effect too impressive to let pass without some
mention. The highlight of such activities was the message we
addressed last April to the world’s religious leaders. This has
given a fresh impulse to the approach being taken by the Bahá’í
community to call the attention of the most influential elements
of society to issues of critical importance to ensuring the peace
of the world. Through the coordinating efforts of the Bahá’í
International Community’s Office of Public Information and
the prompt efficiency of National Spiritual Assemblies, the
message was distributed in a short time to the topmost ranks
and other echelons of religious communities across the globe.
The purpose of the initiative is to bring to the attention of all
concerned the urgent need for religious leadership to address
the problem of religious prejudice, which is becoming a steadily
more serious danger to human well-being. The immediate
reactions from many recipients indicate that the message is
being seriously regarded and is even in some places lending new
perspective to interfaith activities.
In the field of social and economic development a tempo
has been attained that impresses ever more deeply the effects of
institutional and individual effort on both the internal development of the community and the community’s collaboration
with others. The Office of Social and Economic Development
reports that during the second year of the Plan eight new
Bahá’í-­inspired development agencies were established, operating in such diverse fields as the advancement of women, health,
agriculture, child education and youth empowerment.

In the Holy Land, the English translation of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Arabic epistle known as Javáhiru’l-Asrár was released under
the title Gems of Divine Mysteries. The restoration of the Cell
of Bahá’u’lláh in the prison at ‘Akká was completed, and work
began on the remainder of the upper floor of the prison cell
area. As of the next pilgrimage season, beginning in October
2003, the number of pilgrims in each group will be raised from
150 to 200.
Furthermore, efforts at fostering the development of institutions operating at the World Centre were especially evident
in the continuing evolution of the institution of H
. uqúqu’lláh
under the distinguished leadership of the Trustee, the Hand
of the Cause of God ‘Alí-Muh.ammad Varqá. Through his
wise initiative and constant endeavor, Dr. Varqá has inspired
the education of the friends everywhere concerning the law
of H
. uqúqu’lláh. In the decade since the law was universally
applied, a network of national and regional boards of trustees
has been brought into existence, which provides coordination
and direction to the service of an increasing number of deputies
and representatives. Knowledge of this great law has spread
widely, and friends from all continents are responding to it with
a spirit of devotion, which the Trustee hopes will touch those
who have not yet availed themselves of the promised blessings
flowing from adherence to this law.
In the nearly two years since we announced the special
necessity for financial support to maintain, at a befitting
standard, the buildings and gardens at the World Centre, the
World Centre Endowment Fund has been established. The
contributions have not yet reached a level equal to the annual
need. However, we have felt obliged to set aside five million
dollars of the contributions received as an earmarked fund
towards building a corpus to provide a source of investment
income dedicated to the original purpose. We have done so by
drawing upon the Bahá’í International Fund to assist in covering the necessary expenditures, suspending activities in other
fields that it would have been normal to pursue.
We are delighted to advise that, in response to the call
issued by the National Spiritual Assembly of Chile, 185 design
concepts have been received from architects and designers
around the world for the Mother Temple of South America to
be constructed in Santiago. A final choice will be announced in
due course.

Three years of the Five Year Plan have passed. The
processes set in motion in the Four Year Plan, strengthened
through special attention to the Bahá’í education of children
during the Twelve Month Plan, and followed up unflaggingly
during these past years, are now fulfilling the high hopes with
which they were launched. In every part of the world the three
participants in the Plan—the individual, the community and
the institutions—each playing a distinctive role, are reinforcing one another’s actions. The core activities of study circles,
children’s classes and devotional meetings have become essential aspects and mutually enhancing achievements lending
greater vigor and success to all the other elements of Bahá’í
community life. Human resources are being augmented, and
the Local Spiritual Assemblies are responding to the fresh
demands of this rising vitality.
The capacity built for the Bahá’í education of children
throughout the world is extraordinarily impressive. Initial efforts for the spiritual empowerment of junior youth are meeting
with success. The movement of clusters from each level of activity to a higher one is well in hand and, as it proceeds, the kernel
of avowed believers is being joined by a larger circle of people,
still not Bahá’ís but enthusiastically involved in core activities
of the Plan. Structures for administering intensive growth
are already appearing in certain advanced clusters. National
Assemblies, while attending to the needs of all the clusters in
their countries, have learned the value of concentrating special
attention on certain priority clusters that show high promise,
encouraging and developing them until the human resources
they have raised up through the training institutes enable them
to become centers of rapid, sustained growth.

As foreseen, the training institute is proving to be an engine
of growth. On assessing the opportunities and needs of their
respective communities, the great majority of National Spiritual
Assemblies have chosen to adopt the course materials devised
by the Ruhi Institute, finding them most responsive to the Plan’s
needs. This has had the collateral benefit that the same materials have been translated into many languages and, wherever
Bahá’ís travel, they find other friends following the same path
and familiar with the same books and methods.
A chaotic international society, torn by conflicting perceptions and interests, is assailed by rising terrorism, lawlessness
and corruption, and eroded by economic failure, poverty and
disease. In its midst the Bahá’í community is becoming increasingly visible, inspired by a divinely revealed vision, building on
solid foundations, growing in strength through the processes
that are now in place, and undaunted by seeming setbacks.
An example of the capacity of the Bahá’í world to respond
to unexpected conditions occurred a year ago, when multiple
dangers required the cancellation of the International Bahá’í
Convention; the election of the Universal House of Justice was
duly held and the Plan went forward without a missed step.
Concurrently, despite the disruption and chaos of life in Iraq, it
was possible to contact the Bahá’ís in that land and reconstitute
their Local Spiritual Assemblies. Now we announce with great
joy the election, this Rid.ván, of the National Spiritual Assembly
of the Bahá’ís of Iraq, restored after more than thirty years of
stifling oppression, to take its rightful place in the international
Bahá’í community.
What the Divine Plan requires at this stage is for us to
continue confidently and dynamically in the present direction,
undeterred by storms battering the world of humanity. Be sure
that the Blessed Beauty will guide your steps and the Hosts of
the Supreme Concourse will reinforce your every effort for the
progress of His Faith.

Dearly loved Friends,

The breakthroughs that have occurred in the Bahá’í world
since the beginning of the fifth epoch of the Formative Age
have brought us immeasurable joy. The past twelve months
have been no exception. The Bahá’í community has continued
its systematic advance and now, as it enters the final year of
the Five Year Plan, finds itself in a position of remarkable
strength—a strength acquired through strenuous, deliberate
exertion by the friends everywhere to promote the process of
entry by troops.
While inadequate to express the full significance of the
developments taking place, the statistics suggest something of
the scope of what is being achieved. The human resources of the
Faith have steadily multiplied. Altogether, more than 200,000
worldwide have completed Book 1 of the Ruhi Institute, and
many thousands have reached the level where they can effectively act as tutors of the study circles that, with increasing
frequency, are held in every part of the globe, over 10,000 at the
last count. The number of seekers engaged in the core activities
has continued to climb, crossing the 100,000 mark several
months ago. Meanwhile, some 150 clusters have developed to
the point that intensive programs of growth either have been
launched or stand ready to be initiated. There is every indication
that this number will be substantially surpassed by the end of
the Plan.
In celebrating these achievements, one should acknowledge,
equally, the advances in learning that have given rise to them.
Intensive institute campaigns, which pay due attention to the
practice required, have remained the vehicle for stimulating
growth at the cluster level. As the necessary conditions have
thus been created, systematic programs for the expansion and
191

34.1

34.2

34.3

Turning Point

34.4

34.5

34.6

consolidation of the Faith have been launched accordingly.
A valuable body of knowledge about the nature of intensive
programs of growth is accumulating, and certain features of
these endeavors are now well understood. Such programs tend
to consist of a series of cycles, each of several months’ duration,
devoted to planning, expansion, and consolidation. Human
resource development proceeds uninterrupted from one cycle
to the next, ensuring that the process of expansion not only is
sustained but progressively gathers momentum. While undoubtedly many more lessons are still to be garnered, the experience
already gained makes it possible to replicate the approach in an
ever-increasing number of clusters around the world.
That the victories won have both quantitative and
qualitative dimensions is gratifying indeed. At the heart of these
accomplishments lies the continual enhancement of the spiritual life of Bahá’í communities everywhere. This new spiritual
vitality accounts for the growing participation of people of
divers backgrounds in devotional meetings, children’s classes
and study circles, which, in many cases, has resulted in their
recognition of Bahá’u’lláh as God’s Manifestation for this Day
and in their declaration of faith.
New developments have, likewise, taken place at the World
Centre. We have decided that the time is propitious to bring
into being an International Board of Trustees of H
. uqúqu’lláh
to guide and supervise the work of Regional and National
Boards of Trustees of H
. uqúqu’lláh throughout the world. It
will operate in close collaboration with the Chief Trustee, the
Hand of the Cause of God Dr. ‘Alí-Muh.ammad Varqá, and
will be able to benefit from his knowledge and counsel in carrying out its duties. The three members now appointed to the
International Board of Trustees are Sally Foo, Ramin Khadem,
and Grant Kvalheim. Their term of office will be determined at
a later date. The members of the Board will not transfer their
residence to the Holy Land but will utilize the services of the
Office of H
. uqúqu’lláh at the World Centre in performing their
functions.
At all levels and in every direction the Cause is achieving
marked progress—from gains in expansion and consolidation
at the grassroots to institutional ­ developments of an international scope. Such encouraging signs of the growing solidarity
of the community come at a time when evidences of the decline
in society are, alas, all too apparent. No need to review here
192

the features of the breakdown in which a demoralized world
is entrapped. Yet it should not be forgotten that it is precisely
these circumstances which increase receptivity to the Teachings
and create new opportunities for their diffusion.
In our message of 26 November 1999, we referred to a
series of global enterprises designed to carry the Bahá’í community through the final years of the first century of the Faith’s
Formative Age. Each Plan, we indicated, would focus on the
central aim of advancing the process of entry by troops. The
first in the series, the current Five Year Plan, will draw to a
close in twelve short months, when we will call upon the followers of Bahá’u’lláh to embark on another Plan of five years’
duration. What we ask the friends to do in the intervening
period is to bend all their energies to put into resolute action
the systematic learning being so vigorously promoted by the
International Teaching Centre. No Bahá’í should lose the priceless opportunity afforded by the remaining days of the Plan
to reinforce in this way the foundation for the launching next
Rid.ván of an even more ambitious undertaking. Our most
fervent prayers in the Holy Shrines will surround you.

To the Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors
Dearly loved Friends,
35.1

35.2

Over the past four and a half years, as the believers
throughout the world have striven to pursue the aim of advancing the process of entry by troops, it has become increasingly
clear that the close of the present Five Year Plan will mark a
decisive moment in the unfoldment of the historical enterprise
on which the community of the Greatest Name is embarked.
The elements required for a concerted effort to infuse the
diverse regions of the world with the spirit of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation have crystallized into a framework for action that
now needs only to be exploited.
Our 26 December 1995 message, which focused the Bahá’í
world on a path of intense learning about the sustained, rapid
growth of the Faith, described in general terms the nature of
the work that would have to be undertaken in meeting the challenges ahead. As a first step, Bahá’í communities were urged
to systematize their efforts to develop the human resources
of the Cause through a network of training institutes. While
every national community took measures to create institutional
capacity to perform this essential function, it was not until
the outset of the Five Year Plan that the significance of a wellconceived program of training became widely appreciated. The
introduction of the concept of the cluster made it possible for
the friends to think about the accelerated growth of the community on a manageable scale and to conceive of it in terms of
two complementary, reinforcing movements: the steady flow
of individuals through the sequence of institute courses and
the movement of clusters from one stage of development to
the next. This image helped the believers to analyze the lessons
being learned in the field and to employ a common vocabulary
to articulate their findings. Never before have the means for
195

35.1

Turning Point

35.3

establishing a pattern of activity that places equal emphasis on
the twin processes of expansion and consolidation been better
understood. Indeed, so consistent has been the experience with
intensive programs of growth, implemented on the basis of this
understanding in divers clusters, that no cause for equivocation
remains. The way forward is clear, and at Rid.ván 2006 we will
call upon the believers to steel their resolve and to proceed with
the full force of their energies on the course that has been so
decidedly set.
In presenting to you the features of the coming Five Year
Plan, the subject of your deliberations in this conference, we
will review the record of recent accomplishments of the Bahá’í
world and indicate how current approaches, methods and
instruments should be carried to this next stage. What the
analysis will make evident is that the wholehearted response of
the individual believer, the community and the institutions to
the guidance they received five years ago has raised their capacity to new levels. The continued development of this capacity
will remain essential to the aim of advancing the process of
entry by troops—the focus of the Bahá’í world through the final
years of the first century of the Formative Age.

35.3

The Individual
35.4

35.5

There is little need to describe in detail the achievements
of the individual believer, for we have already noted these in
our message of 17 January 2003 to the Bahá’ís of the world.
In that message we highlighted the growing sense of initiative
and resourcefulness, as well as the courage and audacity, that
have come to characterize believers everywhere. Qualities such
as consecration, zeal, confidence and tenacity attest to the
enhanced vitality of their faith. We have also acknowledged
the role played by the training institute in evoking the spirit of
enterprise underlying the rise in activity observed around the
world—the concrete expression of that vitality.
Developments since then have served only to demonstrate
further the efficacy of a sequence of courses that seeks to build
capacity for service by concentrating on the application of
the spiritual insights gained through profound study of the
Writings. Participants are exposed to a body of knowledge
that fosters a set of related habits, attitudes and qualities and
are assisted in sharpening certain skills and abilities needed to
196

35.4

35.5

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

35.6

35.7

carry out acts of service. Discussions that revolve around the
Creative Word, in the serious and uplifting atmosphere of a
study circle, raise the level of consciousness about one’s duties
to the Cause and create an awareness of the joy one derives
from teaching the Faith and serving its interests. The spiritual
context in which specific deeds are addressed endows them with
significance. Confidence is patiently built as the friends engage
in progressively more complex and demanding acts of service.
Yet, above all, it is reliance on God that sustains them in their
endeavors. How abundant the accounts of believers who enter
the teaching field with trepidation only to find themselves
bolstered by confirmations on all sides. Seeing the possibilities
and opportunities before them with new eyes, they witness first
hand the power of Divine assistance, as they strive to put into
practice what they are learning and achieve results far exceeding
their expectations. That the spirit of faith born out of intimate
contact with the Word of God has such an effect on souls is
by no means a new phenomenon. What is heartening is that
the institute process is helping such large numbers experience
the transforming potency of the Faith. To extend this edifying
influence to hundreds of thousands more should be the object
of intense effort over the next five years.
A discernible outcome of the emphasis on capacity building has been a steady increase in the exercise of individual
­initiative—initiative that is disciplined by an understanding of
the requirements of systematic action in advancing the process
of entry by troops. Endeavors are pursued in a humble posture
of learning within the framework defined by the Plan. As a
result, activities that give expression to a diversity of talents
become harmonized into one forward movement, and the
stagnation caused by endless debate over personal preferences
about approach is avoided. Commitment to long-term action
grows, putting in context the initiatives undertaken by the
believers at any particular moment.
Nowhere has the rise in individual initiative been more
clearly demonstrated than in the field of teaching. Whether in
the form of firesides or study circles, individual efforts to teach
the Faith are indisputably on the increase. Equipped with skills
and methods, effective and accessible to all, and encouraged
by the response their actions elicit, the believers are entering
into closer association with people of many walks of life,
engaging them in earnest conversation on themes of spiritual
197

35.6

35.7

Turning Point

35.8

import. With greater and greater spiritual perception, they are
able to sense receptivity and recognize thirst for the vivifying
waters of Bahá’u’lláh’s message. From among all those they
encounter—parents of neighborhood children, peers at school,
colleagues at work, casual acquaintances—they seek out souls
with whom they can share a portion of that which He has so
graciously bestowed on humanity. Increased experience enables
them to adapt their presentation to the seeker’s needs, employing direct teaching methods that draw on the Writings to offer
the message in a manner both forthcoming and inviting.
Most noteworthy in this regard is the spirit of initiative
shown by believers who extend the range of their endeavors
to assist others also striving to tread a path of service. Having
acquired the capacity to serve as tutors of institute courses,
they take up the challenge of accompanying participants in
their initial attempts to perform acts of service until they, too,
are ready to start their own study circles and help others do the
same, widening in this way the scope of the institute’s influence
and bringing eager souls into contact with the Word of God.
This particular aspect of the institute process, which serves to
multiply the number of active supporters of the Faith in a selfperpetuating manner, holds much promise, and we hope that
its potential will be realized in the coming Plan. “Let him not
be content,” are the words of the Guardian referring to every
teacher of the Cause, “until he has infused into his spiritual
child so deep a longing as to impel him to arise independently,
in his turn, and devote his energies to the quickening of other
souls, and the upholding of the laws and principles laid down
by his newly adopted Faith.”

35.8

The Community
35.9

The enhanced vitality that distinguishes the life of the
individual believer is equally evident in Bahá’í community life.
The degree to which this vitality manifests itself depends, of
course, on the stage of development of the cluster. A cluster
in an advanced stage of growth offers far greater insight into
what can be achieved than one in an earlier stage, where the
friends are still struggling to translate the provisions of the Plan
into action. It is to these more advanced clusters, then, that we
must look in analyzing the accomplishments of the community,

convinced that their experience will be emulated by others as
they continue to progress.
On several occasions we have made reference to the
coherence that is brought to the process of growth through
the establishment of study circles, devotional meetings and
children’s classes. The steady multiplication of core activities,
propelled by the training institute, creates a sustainable pattern
of expansion and consolidation that is at once structured and
organic. As seekers join these activities and declare their faith,
individual and collective teaching endeavors gather momentum.
Through the effort made to ensure that a percentage of the
new believers enroll in the institute courses, the pool of human
resources required to carry out the work of the Faith swells.
When strenuously pursued in a cluster, all of this activity
eventually brings about conditions favorable for launching an
intensive program of growth.
What a close examination of clusters at this threshold
confirms is that the coherence thus achieved extends to various
aspects of community life. The study and application of the
teachings become a pervasive habit, and the spirit of communal
worship generated by devotional meetings begins to permeate
the community’s collective endeavors. A graceful integration of
the arts into diverse activities enhances the surge of energy that
mobilizes the believers. Classes for the spiritual education of
children and junior youth serve to strengthen the roots of the
Faith in the local population. Even an act of service as simple
as visiting the home of a new believer, whether in a village in
the Pacific Islands or in a vast metropolitan area like London,
reinforces ties of fellowship that bind the members of the community together. Conceived as a means for exposing believers
to the fundamentals of the Faith, “home visits” are giving rise
to an array of deepening efforts, both individual and collective,
in which the friends are delving into the Writings and exploring
their implications for their lives.
As the spiritual foundations of the community are fortified
in this way, the level of collective discourse is raised, social
relations among the friends take on new meaning, and a sense
of common purpose inspires their interactions. Little wonder,
then, that a study carried out by the International Teaching
Centre shows that, in some fifty advanced clusters surveyed, the
quality of the Nineteen Day Feast has improved. Other reports
indicate that contributions to the Fund have increased as
199

­consciousness of its spiritual significance expands and the need
for material means is better understood. Reflection meetings
at the cluster level are becoming a forum for the discussion of
needs and plans, creating a collective identity and strengthening the collective will. Where such advanced clusters are
flourishing, the influence they exert begins to spread beyond
their own borders to enrich regional events, such as summer
and winter schools.
As in the case of the individual, learning is the hallmark of
this phase of the development of the community. You and your
auxiliaries are urged to exert every effort in the coming years
to ensure that, in cluster after cluster, learning is woven into the
fabric of decision-making.
One of your primary concerns will be to strengthen appreciation for systematic action, already heightened by the
successes it has brought. To arrive at a unified vision of growth
based on a realistic assessment of possibilities and resources, to
develop strategies that lend structure to it, to devise and implement plans of action commensurate with capacity, to make
necessary adjustments while maintaining continuity, to build on
accomplishments—these are some of the requisites of systematization that every community must learn and internalize.
By the same token, desire and willingness to open certain aspects of community life to the wider public should be integrated
into a pattern of behavior that attracts souls and confirms them.
Much has been achieved in this respect as the friends have
adopted new ways of thinking and acting at a collective level.
In welcoming large numbers into its embrace, the community
is learning to see more readily the latent potentiality in people
and to avoid setting artificial barriers for them based on preconceived notions. A nurturing environment is being cultivated
in which each individual is encouraged to progress at his or her
own pace without the pressure of unreasonable expectations.
At the heart of such developments is a growing awareness of
the implications of the universality and comprehensiveness of
the Faith. Collective action is governed more and more by the
principle that Bahá’u’lláh’s message should be given lib­erally
and unconditionally to humanity. Most gratifying are the
endeavors being made to reach receptive populations with the
teachings of the Faith. As unrelenting social and political forces
continue to uproot people from their homelands and sweep
them across continents, an uncompromising appreciation for a
200

35.14

35.15

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

35.16

diversity of backgrounds and for the strength it confers on the
whole will prove crucial to the expansion and consolidation of
the community.
Perhaps the task that will occupy the attention of you and
your auxiliaries above all others is to assist the community in its
effort to maintain focus. This ability, slowly acquired through
successive Plans, represents one of its most valuable assets, hard
won through discipline, commitment and foresight as the friends
and their institutions have learned to pursue the single aim of
advancing the process of entry by troops. On the one hand,
you will find it necessary to discourage the tendency to confuse
focus with uniformity or exclusivity. To maintain focus does not
imply that special needs and interests are neglected, much less
that essential activities are dropped in order to accommodate
others. Clearly, there are a host of elements that comprise
Bahá’í community life, shaped over the decades, which must
be further refined and developed. On the other hand, you will
want to take every opportunity to reinforce the disposition to
prioritize—one which recognizes that not all activities have the
same importance at a given stage of growth, that some must
necessarily take precedence over others, that even the most wellintentioned proposals can cause distraction, dissipate energy
or impede progress. What should be plainly acknowledged is
that the time available for the friends to serve the Faith in every
community is not without limits. It is only natural to expect
that the preponderating share of this limited resource would be
expended in meeting the provisions of the Plan.

35.16

The Institutions
35.17

None of the accomplishments of the individual or the
community could be sustained without the guidance, encouragement and support of the third participant in the Plan—the
institutions of the Faith. It is heartening to see to what extent
the institutions are promoting individual initiative, channeling
energies into the teaching field, underscoring the value of systematic action, fostering the spiritual life of the community and
nurturing a welcoming environment. In helping the community
to remain focused on the aim of the Plan, they are learning
in practical terms what it means to maintain unity of vision
among the friends, to put mechanisms in place that facilitate
their endeavors and to allocate resources in accordance with
201

35.17

Turning Point

35.18

35.19

priorities wisely set. These priorities include, of course, areas of
activity that require the specialized skills of individuals. Worthy
of particular mention in this category are the work of external
affairs, which National Spiritual Assemblies are following
diligently, and ventures of social and economic development,
as, for example, undertaken by Bahá’í-inspired organizations.
While tending to needs of this kind, the institutions find
themselves increasingly capable of directing the thrust of the
effort exerted by the generality of the believers towards the
prosecution of the central tasks of the Plan.
Encouraging, too, are the determined steps being taken
by National Spiritual Assemblies, in collaboration with the
Counsellors, to respond to the administrative challenges
brought by large-scale growth at the cluster level. Schemes that
are emerging tend to call for one or more individuals named
by the training institute to coordinate the delivery of courses
in the main sequence, as well as programs for children and
junior youth. An Area Teaching Committee appointed by the
Regional Council, or by the National Assembly itself, is also
required to administer other aspects of systematic effort to
achieve accelerated expansion and consolidation. Auxiliary
Board members work on both fronts to ensure that the two
movements which have come to characterize the process of
growth proceed unhampered. While these various components
are being established in cluster after cluster, there is still much
to be learned about the functions each is to perform and about
the relationships among them. What is important is that the
current degree of flexibility, which allows for the creation of
new instruments as needed, not be compromised so that the
scheme of coordination represents a response to the demands
of growth itself. We count on you and National Assemblies to
guide this learning process.
Throughout the Plan, we have watched with the keenest
interest the effects of these developments on the functioning
of Local Spiritual Assemblies. It gives us pleasure to note
that two types of progress are being made in this respect. In
those clusters where most of the Local Assemblies have been
extremely weak, a growing number are gradually assuming
their responsibilities as they learn to guide specific activities of
the Plan in the areas under their jurisdiction. At the same time,
long-standing Local Spiritual Assemblies are exhibiting signs
of added strength as they have come to embrace a vision of
202

35.18

35.19

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

35.20

systematic growth—this, often following a period of adjustment
in which some struggled to understand the new realities being
created at the cluster level.
What has brought us particular joy is to see that the process
of growth unfolding around the world is gathering momentum
in urban centers as well as rural areas. An important step
taken in many large cities early in the current Plan was to
divide them into sectors. This proved crucial to planning for
sustained growth. As communities expand, however, it is not
unreasonable to expect that cities will need to be divided into
smaller areas—perhaps ultimately into neighborhoods—in each
of which the Nineteen Day Feast is conducted. Maintaining a
vision of the potential size of future communities is essential
for the further development of Local Assemblies. To administer
the affairs of communities whose membership will swell into
the thousands, and to fulfill their purpose as the “trusted ones
of the Merciful among men,” those who serve on Spiritual
Assemblies will necessarily undergo intense periods of learning
in the years ahead. We intend to monitor the development of
Local Spiritual Assemblies closely during the coming Plan and,
as the size of the Bahá’í population and other circumstances in
a locality demand, authorize a two-stage electoral process on
a case-by-case basis, following the pattern developed in T.ihrán
during the ministry of the Guardian.

35.20

Intensive Programs of Growth
35.21

35.22

Sustained endeavor on the part of the individual, the community and the institutions to accelerate the institute process in
a cluster, while contributing to its movement from one stage of
development to another through well-proven means, culminates
in the launching of an intensive program of growth. Indeed, the
most significant advances in learning during the present Plan
resulted from efforts in some two hundred clusters to implement such programs. We are convinced that this learning can
now be systematically propagated in every continent, and at
Rid.ván 2006 we will call upon Bahá’ís worldwide to establish,
during the next Plan, intensive programs of growth in no less
than 1,500 clusters.
As currently conceived, an intensive program of growth
is straightforward, simple and effective, but implies a level of
exertion that tests the resolve of the friends. Conforming well
203

35.22

Turning Point

35.23

35.24

35.25

to the vision we presented five years ago, it employs a few
measures that have proven to be indispensable to large-scale
expansion and consolidation. It consists of cycles of activity, in
general of three months’ duration each, which proceed according to distinct phases of expansion, consolidation, reflection
and planning.
The expansion phase, often a period of two weeks, demands
the highest level of intensity. Its objective is to widen the circle
of those interested in the Faith, to find receptive souls and to
teach them. Although this phase might include some element
of proclamation, it should not be seen as a time to hold a few
events for this purpose or to undertake a set of activities that
merely convey information. Experience suggests that the more
closely teaching approaches and methods are aligned with the
capacity acquired from the study of the institute courses the
more rewarding the results.
Plans being devised for this phase invariably involve the
implementation of carefully designed teaching projects and
campaigns of home visits and firesides, often through the
mobilization of teaching teams. The pattern of expansion that
unfolds, however, varies from cluster to cluster. Where the
population has traditionally shown a high degree of receptivity
to the Faith, a rapid influx of new believers is to be expected. In
one cluster of this kind, for example, the goal of enrolling fifty
souls over a three-week period in a locality was surpassed by
the second day, and the team wisely decided to end the expansion phase in anticipation of activities related to consolidation.
One of the primary objectives of this next phase is to bring a
percentage of the new believers into the institute process so
that an adequate pool of human resources will be available
in future cycles to sustain growth. Those not participating
in study circles are nurtured through a series of home visits,
and all are invited to devotional meetings, to the celebration
of the Nineteen Day Feast and to Holy Day observances and
are gradually introduced to the patterns of community life.
Not infrequently, the consolidation phase gives rise to further
enrollments as the family members and friends of new declarants accept the Faith.
In other clusters, enrollments during the expansion phase
may not be high, especially in the first few cycles, and the goal
is to augment the number of those willing to participate in core
activities. This, then, defines the nature of the consolidation
204

35.23

35.24

35.25

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

35.26

35.27

phase, which largely involves nurturing the interest of seekers
and accompanying them in their spiritual search until they are
confirmed in their faith. To the extent that these measures are
vigorously followed, this phase can generate a considerable
number of enrollments. It should be noted, however, that as
learning advances and experience is gained, the ability not only
to teach responsive souls, but also to identify segments of the
general population with heightened receptivity, develops, and
the totality of new believers increases from cycle to cycle.
Whatever the nature of the cluster, it is imperative to
pay close attention to children and junior youth everywhere.
Concern for the moral and spiritual education of young people
is asserting itself forcefully on the consciousness of humanity,
and no attempt at community building can afford to ignore it.
What has become especially apparent during the current Five
Year Plan is the efficacy of educational programs aimed at the
spiritual empowerment of junior youth. When accompanied for
three years through a program that enhances their spiritual perception, and encouraged to enter the main sequence of institute
courses at the age of fifteen, they represent a vast reservoir of
energy and talent that can be devoted to the advancement of
spiritual and material civilization. So impressed are we by the
results already achieved, and so compelling is the need, that we
will urge all National Assemblies to consider the junior youth
groups formed through programs implemented by their training
institutes a fourth core activity in its own right and to promote
its wide-scale multiplication.
Key to the progress of an intensive program of growth is
the phase dedicated to reflection, in which the lessons learned
in action are articulated and incorporated into plans for the
next cycle of activity. Its principal feature is the reflection
meeting—as much a time of joyous celebration as it is of
serious consultation. Careful analysis of experience, through
participatory discussions rather than overly complex and
elaborate presentations, serves to maintain unity of vision,
sharpen clarity of thought and heighten enthusiasm. Central to
such an analysis is the review of vital statistics that suggest the
next set of goals to be adopted. Plans are made that take into
account increased capacity in terms of the human resources
available at the end of the cycle to perform various tasks, on
the one hand, and accumulated knowledge about the receptivity
of the population and the dynamics of teaching, on the other.
205

35.28

35.29

35.30

When human resources increase in a manner proportionate to
the rise in the overall Bahá’í population from cycle to cycle, it
is possible not only to sustain but to accelerate growth.
To meet the ambitious goal of establishing 1,500 such
intensive programs, the Bahá’í world will have to draw fully
upon the experience gained and capacity built over the past
ten years. Following your departure from the Holy Land, you
will need to enter into thorough consultation with National
Spiritual Assemblies and Regional Councils and together carefully assess conditions in each national community in order to
identify the clusters that will receive focused attention and to
map out strategic plans.
Implementation of these plans should begin as soon as possible after Rid.ván 2006. Experience in advancing the movement
of clusters from one stage to the next is now so widespread that
the methods and instruments are well understood. The institute
process must be strengthened so that a sizeable number of
friends proceed through the main sequence of courses. Intensive
institute campaigns that pay adequate attention to the practice
component will be essential in this respect. The number of
core activities should be steadily multiplied, and outreach to
the wider community systematically extended. Meetings of
reflection will have to be held periodically in order to monitor
progress, maintain unity of thought and mobilize the energies
of the friends. And schemes for administering the growth process should gradually be put in place, as circumstances demand.
While capacity at the level of the cluster to sustain growth will
remain the most compelling concern in the coming years, the
ongoing development of regional and national structures to
facilitate the flow of information and resources to and from the
field of action cannot be neglected.
Equally important will be the support lent to a cluster
through an influx of pioneers. The desire to pioneer arises
naturally from deep within the heart of the individual believer
as a response to the Divine summons. Whosoever forsakes
his or her home for the purpose of teaching the Cause joins
the ranks of those noble souls whose achievements down
the decades have illumined the annals of Bahá’í pioneering.
We cherish the hope that many will be moved to render this
meritorious service during the next Plan, whether on the home
front or in the international field—an act that, in itself, attracts
untold blessings. The institutions, in turn, will have to exercise
206

35.28

35.29

35.30

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

35.31

35.32

sound judgment to ensure that such friends are strategically
placed. Priority should be given to settling short-term and longterm pioneers in those clusters that are the focus of systematic
attention, whether as a means of reinforcing endeavors to lay
the groundwork for accelerated growth or stabilizing cycles
of activity under way. It is not unreasonable to assume that a
concerted effort to build on strength will result in the eventual
outflow of pioneers from such clusters to areas destined to
become the theatre of future conquests.
Dear Friends: In the weeks and months ahead and over the
course of the Plan, you and your auxiliaries will be a constant
source of encouragement to the believers as they rise to the
challenge being presented to them. We ask that you take every
opportunity to convey to them our confidence in their capacity
to overcome the obstacles that will inevitably appear in their
path. They should not fail to recognize the scope of what they
have achieved through the sustaining grace of Bahá’u’lláh over
the past decade. In the course of the first four years, they created the institutional capacity throughout the planet to impart
spiritual education to growing contingents of believers. Building
on this accomplishment, they engaged in a rigorous process of
learning that opened before their eyes vistas of great yet attainable possibilities. That the Bahá’í world has succeeded in
multiplying the number of devotional meetings sixfold over the
past five years, that classes for children and junior youth have
increased more than threefold during the same period, that the
number of study circles worldwide has surpassed eleven thousand—these provide a measure of the extraordinary strength
the believers can draw upon in shouldering the responsibility
entrusted to them.
Above all, the friends need to remain ever conscious of the
magnitude of the spiritual forces that are at their disposition.
They are members of a community “whose world-embracing,
continually consolidating activities constitute the one integrating process in a world whose institutions, secular as well as
religious, are for the most part dissolving.” Of all the peoples
of the world, “they alone can recognize, amidst the welter of a
tempestuous age, the Hand of the Divine Redeemer that traces
its course and controls its destinies. They alone are aware of
the silent growth of that orderly world polity whose fabric they
themselves are weaving.” It is their institutions that “will come
to be regarded as the hallmark and glory of the age” they have
207

35.31

35.32

Turning Point

been called upon to establish. The “building process,” to which
they are consecrated, is “the one hope of a stricken society.”
For, it is “actuated by the generating influence of God’s changeless Purpose, and is evolving within the framework of the
Administrative Order of His Faith.” And remind them that
they are the illumined souls envisioned by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His
prayer: “Heroes are they, O my Lord, lead them to the field of
battle. Guides are they, make them to speak out with arguments
and proofs. Ministering servants are they, cause them to pass
round the cup that brimmeth with the wine of certitude. O my
God, make them to be songsters that carol in fair gardens, make
them lions that couch in the thickets, whales that plunge in the
vasty deep.”

28 December 2005
To all National Spiritual Assemblies
Dear Bahá’í Friends,
36.1

36.2

In the coming weeks you will be engaged in consultations
on the features of the next Five Year Plan as described in our
message dated 27 December 2005 to the Conference of the
Continental Boards of Counsellors. We feel that these deliberations will benefit from the following comments regarding the
curriculum of the training institute.
When in our message dated 26 December 1995 we under­
scored the need for a formal program of training, we were
aware that certain elements of a curriculum meeting the necessary requirements existed in the materials of the Ruhi Institute.
It was our conviction, however, that the accumulated experience at that point did not justify our recommending a specific
set of materials to be used by training institutes throughout the
world. Therefore, the messages written by us and on our behalf
in the early part of the Four Year Plan encouraged National
Spiritual Assemblies and the Counsellors to open the way for
training institutes to follow whatever curriculum they deemed
appropriate. Yet, conscious of the inherent difficulty in creating
comprehensive programs, we repeatedly expressed the view
that the execution of plans should not await protracted decisions on the question of curriculum and that materials readily
available should be used. The availability of such materials
was limited worldwide, and National Spiritual Assemblies and
institute boards began to adopt the books of the Ruhi Institute
as they became aware of them, often through the Counsellors.
By the time the Four Year Plan came to a close, it was all too
apparent that national communities which had vigorously set
out to implement the sequence of courses designed by the Ruhi
Institute were far ahead of those who had attempted to develop
their own program.
209

36.1

36.2

Turning Point
36.3

36.4

36.5

It was the Five Year Plan, however, that served to convince
Counsellors, National Assemblies and boards everywhere of the
merits of the Ruhi Institute curriculum. The introduction of the
seventh book in the Institute’s main sequence at the start of the
Plan enabled many to appreciate more the intimate connection
between the flow of individuals through a sequence of courses
and the movement of clusters from one stage of growth to the
next. Indeed, as progress was achieved in hundreds of clusters,
it became clear to institutions at all levels that the content and
order of the main sequence prepared the friends to carry out
those acts of service required by the pattern of growth being
established in a cluster. We have, in fact, described the dynamics
of this relationship in our message of 27 December 2005.
We have now familiarized ourselves with the Ruhi Institute’s
present plans for curriculum development, which increasingly draw on experience worldwide in sustaining large-scale
expan­sion and consolidation. We welcome the decision of the
Institute, for example, to move the book currently occupying
the fifth position in the sequence to a set of courses branching
out from Book 3 for preparing Bahá’í children’s class teachers
and to insert in the fifth place a new book for raising up animators of junior youth groups. That the eighth book in the main
sequence, initiating a series concerned with the institutional
aspects of service to the Cause, will address the all-important
question of the Covenant is noted with equal pleasure. With
these thoughts in mind, we have reached the conclusion that the
books of the Ruhi Institute should constitute the main sequence
of courses for institutes everywhere, at least through the final
years of the first century of the Formative Age when the Bahá’í
community will be focused on advancing the process of entry
by troops within the framework for action set forth in our
27 December message.
To select one curriculum to be used by training institutes
worldwide for a certain period of time is not to ignore the
variety of needs and interests of the friends as they endeavor to
better equip themselves to understand and apply the teachings
of Bahá’u’lláh. Nor does it in any way diminish the value of
the efforts made to develop courses and materials to respond
to these needs. It is not intended to suggest, either, that one
curriculum should necessarily appeal to everyone. What this
decision does imply, however, is that the present demands of
the growth of the Faith are such that, for some years to come,
210

36.3

36.4

36.5

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

36.6

36.7

training institutes should not attempt to meet all of the needs
and interests of the friends.
The institutions of the Faith will continue to respect the
wishes of those who, for whatever reason, do not feel inclined
to participate in the study of the books of the Ruhi Institute.
Those not so disposed should recognize that there are many
avenues of service open to them, including, above all, individual
teaching which is the paramount duty of every Bahá’í. Local
deepening classes and summer and winter schools, which
remain an important feature of Bahá’í community life, will provide ample opportunities for them to deepen their knowledge of
the teachings. What we ask of such friends, as we have in the
past, is that they not allow their personal preferences to hamper
in any way the unfoldment of an educational process that has
shown the potential to embrace millions of souls from divers
backgrounds. Regarding the materials that have been developed
in other contexts over the years, and which will continue to
emerge, these surely have their proper place in the Bahá’í
community. Some, for example, form the basis for deepening
classes at the grassroots, while others, with the necessary modifications, can be situated along one of the branches of courses
stemming out from the Ruhi Institute’s main sequence.
In this connection, we feel that the subject of branch
courses deserves a few words of explanation. In our message
dated 9 January 2001 to the Conference of the Continental
Boards of Counsellors, we indicated that the main sequence
could be likened to the trunk of a tree, which supports other
courses branching out from it, each branch addressing some
specific area of action. A set of health materials being developed
in Africa offers a good illustration of a few features of such
courses. Following years of training community health workers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, several Bahá’í agencies
­decided to elaborate a series of modules aimed at preparing
individuals to deal with progressively more complex health
issues at the local level. By the time the first module began to
be used in its initial form, the institute process had gained in
strength, and it became evident that those who had studied
Books 1 and 2 of the Ruhi Institute were better prepared to
visit members of their extended families and friends and speak
on health-related subjects. The design of the modules was
modified so that they could constitute a branch after Book 2,
which participants study while they continue along in the
211

36.6

36.7

Turning Point

main sequence. Efforts in this direction have met with definite
success. This example illustrates that branch courses are not a
disconnected collection of materials randomly placed at various
points. Rather, they must emerge out of actual experience and
adhere to a certain logic, both internally and in the context of
the overall institute program, if they are to be pedagogically
sound. Further, the very concept of a branch course suggests
that it provides training for an area of service which will
interest only some of those who are studying the books of the
main sequence. We hope that the development of such courses
to address specific needs, defined by action on the ground,
will be a natural consequence of the endeavors of burgeoning
communities which are avidly striving to translate into reality
the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh and to use training materials as
a means of systematizing their experience and sharing with
increasing numbers the insights they gain.

As the gathering of the Continental Counsellors in the Holy
Land draws to a close, we are moved to share with you the feelings of joy, triumph and confidence which have characterized
several days of focused deliberation on the present Five Year
Plan and on the global enterprise that will succeed it.
The Hand of the Cause of God ‘Alí-Muh.ammad Varqá
opened the conference with a stirring appeal for resolute
action, infusing the proceedings with a spirit of unwavering
determination. Stories poured forth of the inspiring activities of
the friends and the longing and responsiveness of the peoples of
the world, conveying assurances that the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh is
blossoming more abundantly in all parts of the globe. Persistent
questions of how to sustain the process of growth, of how to
achieve a balance between expansion and consolidation, that
have engaged the Bahá’í community for nearly half a century
found clear answers in the experiences shared from diverse
clusters on all continents. Accounts of obstacles surmounted,
fresh learning acquired, and creative insights discovered made it
evident that the Army of Light is prepared to advance towards
new horizons.
There can be no doubt that the Plan soon to end marks an
upturn in the fortunes of the Faith. We look to the next decade
and a half, the final years of the first century of the Formative
Age, with great expectations of what will be accomplished.
From this vantage point, the Bahá’í world can readily appreciate the significant extent to which the International Teaching
Centre provided the impetus so indispensable to blazing the
course set over these past few years and can, as well, discern
the rich possibilities that its consecrated endeavors portend for
the future.

only on those whose resolve is steeled through experience. The
entire Bahá’í world is stirred at contemplating the scope of the
five-year enterprise that lies ahead, the depth of consecration
it will demand, and the results it is destined to achieve. Our
prayers join yours as you turn in gratitude to Bahá’u’lláh for
the privilege of witnessing the unfoldment of His purpose for
humanity.
In our message of 27 December 2005 to the Counsellors
gathered in the Holy Land, transmitted on that same day to
all National Spiritual Assemblies, we delineated the features
of the Five Year Plan that will stretch from 2006 to 2011. The
friends and their institutions were urged to study the message
thoroughly, and its content is no doubt well familiar to you.
We now call upon each and every one of you to bend your
energies towards ensuring that the goal of establishing over
the next five years intensive programs of growth in no less
than 1,500 clusters worldwide is successfully met. That in the
months following the Counsellors’ departure from the World
Centre the groundwork for the Plan’s launch was laid so rapidly and systematically in country after country is an indication
of the eagerness with which the Bahá’í community is taking up
the challenge presented to it. While there is no need for us to
elaborate further on the requirements of the Plan here, we feel
compelled to offer for your reflection a few comments on the

215

38.5

global context in which your individual and collective efforts
will be pursued.
More than seventy years ago Shoghi Effendi penned his
World Order letters in which he provided a penetrating analysis
of the forces operating in the world. With an eloquence that
was his alone, he described two great processes that have been
set in motion by Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation, one destructive and
the other integrative, both of which are propelling humanity
towards the World Order He conceived. We were cautioned by
the Guardian not to be “misled by the painful slowness characterizing the unfoldment of the civilization” being laboriously
established or to be “deluded by the ephemeral manifestations
of returning prosperity which at times appear to be capable of
checking the disruptive influence of the chronic ills afflicting
the institutions of a decaying age.” No review of the course of
events in recent decades can fail to acknowledge the gathering momentum of the processes he analyzed then with such
precision.
One need only consider the deepening moral crisis engulfing humanity to appreciate the extent to which the forces of
disintegration have rent the fabric of society. Have not the
evidences of selfishness, of suspicion, of fear and of fraud,
which the Guardian perceived with such clarity, become
so widespread as to be readily apparent to even the casual
observer? Does not the threat of terrorism of which he spoke
loom so large on the international scene as to preoccupy the
minds of young and old alike in every corner of the globe?
Have not the unquenchable thirst for, and the feverish pursuit
after, earthly vanities, riches and pleasures so consolidated
their power and influence as to assume authority over such
human values as happiness, fidelity and love? Have not the
weakening of family solidarity and the irresponsible attitude
towards marriage reached such proportions as to endanger the
existence of this fundamental unit of society? “The perversion
of human nature, the degradation of human conduct, the corruption and dissolution of human institutions,” about which
Shoghi Effendi forewarned, are sadly revealing themselves “in
their worst and most revolting aspects.”
The Guardian lays the greatest share of the blame for
humanity’s moral downfall on the decline of religion as a social
force. “Should the lamp of religion be obscured,” he draws our
attention to the words of Bahá’u’lláh, “chaos and confusion
216

38.3

38.4

38.5

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

38.6

will ensue, and the lights of fairness, of justice, of tranquility
and peace cease to shine.” The decades that followed the writing of his letters have seen not only a continued deterioration
in the ability of religion to exercise moral influence, but also
the betrayal of the masses through the unseemly conduct of
religious institutions. Attempts at reinvigorating it have only
given rise to a fanaticism that, if left unchecked, could destroy
the foundation of civilized relationships among people. The
persecution of the Bahá’ís in Iran, recently intensified, is ample
evidence alone of the determination of the forces of darkness
to quench the flame of faith wherever it burns brightly. Though
confident in the ultimate triumph of the Cause, we dare not
forget the warning of the Guardian that the Faith will have to
contend with enemies more powerful and more insidious than
those who have afflicted it in the past.
There is no need to comment extensively on the impotence
of statesmanship, another theme treated so masterfully by the
Guardian in his World Order letters. The widening economic
divide between the rich and the poor, the persistence of age-old
animosities among nations, the swelling numbers of the displaced, the extraordinary rise in organized crime and violence,
the pervasive sense of insecurity, the breakdown of basic services
in so many regions, the indiscriminate exploitation of natural
resources—these are but a few of the signs of the inability of
world leaders to devise viable schemes to alleviate humanity’s
ills. This is not to say that sincere efforts have not been exerted,
in fact, have not multiplied decade after decade. Yet these efforts, no matter how ingenious, fall well short of removing “the
root cause of the evil that has so rudely upset the equilibrium
of present-day society.” “Not even,” the Guardian asserted,
“would the very act of devising the machinery required for the
political and economic unification of the world . . . provide in
itself the antidote against the poison that is steadily undermining the vigor of organized peoples and nations.” “What else,”
he confidently affirmed, “but the unreserved acceptance of the
Divine Program” enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh, “embodying in its
essentials God’s divinely appointed scheme for the unification
of mankind in this age, coupled with an indomitable conviction in the unfailing efficacy of each and all of its provisions,
is eventually capable of withstanding the forces of internal
disintegration which, if unchecked, must needs continue to eat
into the vitals of a despairing society.”
217

38.6

38.7

38.8

Penetrating, indeed, is Shoghi Effendi’s depiction of the
process of disintegration accelerating in the world. Equally
striking is the accuracy with which he analyzed the forces associated with the process of integration. He spoke of a “gradual
diffusion of the spirit of world solidarity which is spontaneously arising out of the welter of a disorganized society” as
an indirect manifestation of Bahá’u’lláh’s conception of the
principle of the oneness of humankind. This spirit of solidarity
has continued to spread over the decades, and today its effect
is apparent in a range of developments, from the rejection of
deeply ingrained racial prejudices to the dawning consciousness
of world citizenship, from heightened environmental awareness
to collaborative efforts in the promotion of public health,
from the concern for human rights to the systematic pursuit
of universal education, from the establishment of interfaith
activities to the efflorescence of hundreds of thousands of local,
national and international organizations engaged in some form
of social action.
Yet for the followers of Bahá’u’lláh the most significant
developments in the process of integration are those directly
related to the Faith, many of which were nurtured by the
Guardian himself and which have advanced tremendously
since their modest beginnings. From the small nucleus of
believers to whom he imparted his first teaching plans has
grown a worldwide community with a presence in thousands
of localities, each following a well-established pattern of activity that embodies the Faith’s principles and aspirations. Upon
the foundation of the Administrative Order he so painstakingly
laid during the early decades of his ministry has been raised
a large, closely knit network of National and Local Spiritual
Assemblies diligently administering the affairs of the Cause in
more than one hundred and eighty countries. From the first
contingents of Auxiliary Board members for the Protection and
Propagation of the Faith brought into being by him has arisen
a legion of nearly one thousand stalwart workers serving in the
field under the direction of eighty-one Counsellors ably guided
by the International Teaching Centre. The evolution of the
World Administrative Center of the Faith, within the precincts
of its World Spiritual Center, a process to which the Guardian
consecrated so much energy, has crossed a crucial threshold
with the occupation by the Universal House of Justice of its
Seat on Mount Carmel and the subsequent completion of the
218

38.7

38.8

Selected Messages of the Universal House of Justice

38.9

International Teaching Centre Building and the Centre for
the Study of the Texts. The Institution of H
. uqúqu’lláh has
steadily progressed under the stewardship of the Hand of the
Cause of God Dr. ‘Alí-Muh.ammad Varqá, appointed Trustee
by Shoghi Effendi fifty years ago, culminating in the establishment in 2005 of an international board designed to promote
the continued widespread application of this mighty law, a
source of inestimable blessings for all humanity. The efforts of
the Guardian to raise the profile of the Faith in international
circles have developed into an extensive external affairs system, capable of both defending the interests of the Faith and
proclaiming its universal message. The respect the Faith enjoys
in international fora, whenever its representatives speak, is a
most noteworthy accomplishment. The loyalty and devotion
that the members of a community reflecting the diversity of the
entire human race evince towards the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh
constitute a storehouse of strength the like of which no other
organized group can claim.
The Guardian foresaw that, in succeeding epochs of the
Formative Age, the Universal House of Justice would launch
a series of worldwide enterprises which would “symbolize
the unity and coordinate and unify the activities” of National
Spiritual Assemblies. Over the course of three successive epochs
now, the Bahá’í community has labored assiduously within the
framework of the global Plans issued by the House of Justice
and has succeeded in establishing a pattern of Bahá’í life that
promotes the spiritual development of the individual and channels the collective energies of its members towards the spiritual
revival of society. It has acquired the capacity to reach large
numbers of receptive souls with the message, to confirm them,
and to deepen their understanding of the essentials of the Faith
they have embraced. It has learned to translate the principle of
consultation enunciated by its Founder into an effective tool
for collective decision-making and to educate its members in
its use. It has devised programs for the spiritual and moral
education of its younger members and has extended them not
only to its own children and junior youth but also to those of
the wider community. With the pool of talent at its disposition,
it has created a rich body of literature which includes volumes
in scores of languages that address both its own needs and
the interest of the general public. It has become increasingly
involved in the affairs of society at large, undertaking a host of
219

38.9

Turning Point

38.10

38.11

projects of social and economic development. Particularly since
the opening of the fifth epoch in 2001, it has made significant
strides in multiplying its human resources through a program
of training that reaches the grassroots of the community and
has discovered methods and instruments for establishing a
sustainable pattern of growth.
It is in the context of the interplay of the forces described
here that the imperative of advancing the process of entry by
troops must be viewed. The Five Year Plan now opening requires that you concentrate your energies on this process and
ensure that the two complementary movements at its heart are
accelerated. This should be your dominant concern. As your
efforts bear fruit and the dynamics of growth reach a new level
of complexity, there will be challenges and opportunities for the
World Centre itself to address in the coming five years in fields
such as external affairs, social and economic development,
administration, and the application of Bahá’í law. The growth
of the community has already necessitated that new arrangements be put in place to double the number of pilgrims to four
hundred in each group beginning in October 2007. There are
several other projects that will also have to be pursued. Among
these are the further development of the gardens surrounding
the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, as well as the Rid.ván Garden and
Mazra‘ih; the restoration of the International Archives Building;
structural repairs to the Shrine of the Báb, the full extent of
which are not yet clear; and the construction of the House of
Worship in Chile as envisioned by the Guardian, the last of the
continental Mashriqu’l-Adhkárs. As these endeavors advance,
we will call on you from time to time for assistance, both in
the form of financial support and specialized talents, mindful
that the resources of the Faith should, to the greatest measure
possible, be channeled to the requirements of the Plan.
Dear friends: That the forces of disintegration are gaining
in range and power cannot be ignored. It is equally clear that
the community of the Greatest Name has been guided from
strength to strength by the Hand of Providence and must now
increase in size and augment its resources. The course set by
the Five Year Plan is straightforward. How can those of us
aware of the plight of humanity, and conscious of the direction
in which history is unfolding, not arise to the fullest of our
capacity and dedicate ourselves to its aim? Do not the words of
the Guardian that “the stage is set” hold as true for us today as

Let his words ring in your ears: “There is no time to lose.”

complete victory.” Be assured of our continued prayers at the
Sacred Threshold for your guidance and protection.

Part II
Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

A

number of concepts are integral to understanding
the recent global Plans of the Faith, and Part II consists

of a document dated 29 October 2005 prepared by
an ad hoc committee for a workshop presented as part of the
Serving the Divine Plan Program at the Bahá’í World Centre.
In the document, passages from letters written by or on behalf
of the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice are used to
explore a few of the most essential concepts such as advancing
the process of entry by troops, two essential movements, and
learning in action. The document also explores areas in which
significant learning has taken place within the Bahá’í community from the start of the Four Year Plan at Rid.ván 1996,
through the Twelve Month and Five Year Plans, until the end
of 2005, when the provisions of a new global enterprise were
announced by the Universal House of Justice.

39
Advancing the Process
of Entry by Troops

39.1

In its message of 26 December 1995 to the Conference of
the Continental Boards of Counsellors, the Universal House
of Justice announced that the Bahá’í world would embark
upon a four-year global enterprise at Rid.ván 1996 aiming at
a significant advance in the process of entry by troops. The
advance was to be achieved through marked progress in the
activity and development of the individual, the institutions, and
the local community—the three participants of the Four Year
Plan. The House of Justice went on to explain the significance
of this step:

39.1

39.2

That an advance in this process depends on the progress
of all three of these intimately connected participants is
abundantly clear. The next four years must witness a dramatic upsurge in effective teaching activities undertaken at
the initiative of the individual. Thousands upon thousands
of believers will need to be aided to express the vitality of
their faith through constancy in teaching the Cause and by
supporting the plans of their institutions and the endeavors
of their communities. They should be helped to realize
that their efforts will be sustained by the degree to which
their inner life and private character “mirror forth in their
manifold aspects the splendor of those eternal principles
proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh.” An acceleration in the tempo
of individual teaching must necessarily be complemented by
a multiplication in the number of regional and local teaching projects. To this end the institutions should be assisted
in increasing their ability to consult according to Bahá’í
principles, to unify the friends in a common vision, and
to use their talents in service to the Cause. Furthermore,
those who enter the Faith must be integrated into vibrant

39.2

225

Turning Point

local communities, characterized by tolerance and love
and guided by a strong sense of purpose and collective
will, environments in which the capacities of all components—men, women, youth and children—are developed
and their powers multiplied in unified action.1
39.3

The House of Justice indicated in November 1999 that
advancing the process of entry by troops would continue to be
the aim of the Plans through the first century of the Formative
Age of the Faith:

39.3

39.4

The two stages in the unfoldment of the Divine Plan
lying immediately ahead will last one year and five years
respectively. At Rid.ván 2000 the Bahá’í world will be asked
to embark on the first of these two stages, a twelve-month
effort aimed at concentrating the forces, the capacities
and the insights that have so strongly emerged. The Five
Year Plan that follows will initiate a series of worldwide
enterprises that will carry the Bahá’í community through
the final twenty years in the first century of the Faith’s
Formative Age. These global Plans will continue to focus
on advancing the process of entry by troops and on its
systematic acceleration.2

39.4

39.5

The House of Justice elaborated on the nature of this aim
and the process it advances in its Rid.ván 1996 message to the
Bahá’ís of the world, stating that

39.5

39.6

The phrase “advance in the process of entry by troops”
accommodates the concept that current circumstances
demand and existing opportunities allow for a sustained
growth of the Bahá’í world community on a large
scale; that this upsurge is necessary in the face of world
conditions; that the three constituent participants in the
upbuilding of the Order of Bahá’u’lláh—the individual, the
institutions, and the community—can foster such growth
first by spiritually and mentally accepting the possibility of
it, and then by working towards embracing masses of new
believers, setting in motion the means for effecting their
spiritual and administrative training and development,
thereby multiplying the number of knowledgeable, active
teachers and administrators whose involvement in the work
of the Cause will ensure a constant influx of new adherents,

39.6

226

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

39.7

an uninterrupted evolution of Bahá’í Assemblies, and a
steady consolidation of the community.
Moreover, to advance the process implies that that
process is already in progress and that local and national
communities are at different stages of it. All communities
are now tasked to take steps and sustain efforts to achieve
a level of expansion and consolidation commensurate with
their possibilities. The individual and the institutions, while
operating in distinctive spheres, are summoned to arise to
meet the requirements of this crucial time in the life of our
community and in the fortunes of all humankind.3

39.7

39.8

The process of entry by troops was described by the
House of Justice in a message dated 9 November 1993 in these
terms:

39.8

39.9

. . . entry by troops is not merely a stage of the progress of
the Cause destined to occur in its own good time, dependent on the receptivity of the population as a whole—it
is a phenomenon which the Bahá’í communities, by their
own activities, can prepare for and help to bring about. It
is also a process which, once started, can be sustained. By
a wise allocation of resources and the energetic pursuit of
simultaneous plans of expansion, deepening and consolidation, the process of entry by troops should bring about a
rapidly increasing supply of active believers, soundly based
local communities, and steadily evolving local and national
Bahá’í institutions.4

39.9

39.10

Of course, it has been explained by the Guardian that entry
by troops is a stage in the growth of the Faith that presages the
day when mass conversion on the part of the diverse peoples of
the world will take place:

39.10

39.11

. . . winning to the Faith fresh recruits to the slowly yet
steadily advancing army of the Lord of Hosts, whose
reinforcing strength is so essential to the safeguarding of
the victories which the band of heroic Bahá’í conquerors
are winning in the course of their several campaigns in all
the continents of the globe.
Such a steady flow of reinforcements is absolutely
vital and is of extreme urgency, for nothing short of the
vitalizing influx of new blood that will reanimate the world
Bahá’í Community can safeguard the prizes which, at so

39.11

39.12

227

39.12

Turning Point

39.13

great a sacrifice, involving the expenditure of so much
time, effort and treasure, are now being won in virgin
territories by Bahá’u’lláh’s valiant Knights, whose privilege
is to constitute the spearhead of the onrushing battalions
which, in divers theatres and in circumstances often adverse
and extremely challenging, are vying with each other for
the spiritual conquest of the unsurrendered territories and
islands on the surface of the globe.
This flow, moreover, will presage and hasten the advent
of the day which, as prophesied by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, will witness the entry by troops of peoples of divers nations and
races into the Bahá’í world—a day which, viewed in its
proper perspective, will be the prelude to that long-awaited
hour when a mass conversion on the part of these same
nations and races, and as a direct result of a chain of events,
momentous and possibly catastrophic in nature and which
cannot as yet be even dimly visualized, will suddenly revolutionize the fortunes of the Faith, derange the equilibrium
of the world, and reinforce a thousandfold the numerical
strength as well as the material power and the spiritual
authority of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.5

228

39.13

40
Two Essential Movements

40.1

In a message to a conference held a few months into the Five
Year Plan in 2001, the Universal House of Justice first explicitly
referred to the concept of two essential movements:

40.1

40.2

The Five Year Plan, which will undoubtedly be the
focus of your consultations over the next few days, requires
concentrated and sustained attention to two essential movements. The first is the steady flow of believers through the
sequence of courses offered by training institutes, for the
purpose of developing the human resources of the Cause.
The second, which receives its impetus from the first, is the
movement of geographic clusters from one stage of growth
to the next.1

40.2

40.3

The first movement, then, is essentially an educational
process at the grassroots of the community. The following quotation from a letter written on behalf of the House of Justice to
a National Spiritual Assembly makes clear the responsibility of
the institute in overseeing this process:

40.3

40.4

At this point in the growth of the Faith, the mandate
of your training institute is fairly clear-cut: A sequence of
courses has been adopted as the national program for the
development of human resources. It is the job of the institute, then, to help a steadily increasing number of youth
and adults advance through that sequence. . . .2

40.4

40.5

A number of messages written by the House of Justice or
on its behalf explain that the sequence of courses adopted by
institutes should “endow growing contingents of believers with
the knowledge, spiritual qualities, and skills and abilities to
effectively carry out the many tasks of expansion and consolidation.”3 The following passage describes in the briefest way

40.5

229

Turning Point

how this educational process was set in motion at the outset of
the Four Year Plan in 1996 and taken to the grassroots:
40.6

During the Four Year Plan, enormous effort was exerted
in raising up training institutes in every part of the globe. To
reach an increasing number of believers with their programs,
institutes were encouraged to adopt a decentralized system
for the delivery of courses. Study circles, guided by trained
tutors, enabled the educational process to be taken to the
local community. As more and more believers in each country entered the institute program in this way and advanced
through its sequence of courses, the human resources of the
Faith steadily grew at different levels of capacity.4

40.6

40.7

The establishment of this educational process was one of
the major accomplishments of the Four Year Plan. The first
movement was well under way, then, by the end of those four
years. The concept of the second movement was introduced at
the start of the Five Year Plan in 2001 when National Spiritual
Assemblies were asked to divide their countries into small
geographic areas that would enable the friends “to think about
the growth of the Faith on a manageable scale and to design
and implement plans close to the grassroots.”5 As a significant
number of believers proceeded through the sequence of courses,
they were now to be deployed at the level of the cluster to meet
the needs of expansion and consolidation. “The educational
process in which the friends have engaged over so many weeks
and months,” it has been explained, “should give shape to
the individual and collective activities they now undertake.”6
The House of Justice underscored this point to the National
Spiritual Assembly of Brazil in a letter written on its behalf:

40.7

40.8

. . . the [Regional Bahá’í] Council must ensure that, as the
ranks of avowed supporters of the Faith swell through the
institute process, they are deployed in the field of service,
reinforcing the work of large-scale expansion and consolidation. This multiplication and deployment of human
resources is to be carried out, of course, in the context of
a regional plan to move each cluster in the region from its
current stage of growth to the next advanced stage.7

40.8

40.9

From the above passage it is clear that the multiplication
and deployment of human resources is carried out in the context of a plan to move a cluster from one stage of growth to the

40.9

230

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

next. The 17 January 2003 message of the House of Justice to
the Bahá’ís of the world further elaborates on this idea:
40.10

40.11

40.12

During the initial months of the Plan, National Spiritual
Assemblies proceeded with relative ease to divide the territories under their jurisdiction into areas consisting of adjacent
localities, called clusters, using criteria that were purely
geographic and social and did not relate to the strength of
local Bahá’í communities. Reports received at the World
Centre indicate that there are now close to 17,000 clusters
worldwide, excluding those countries where, for one reason
or another, the operation of the Faith is restricted. The
number of clusters per country varies widely—from India
with its 1,580 to Singapore, which necessarily sees itself as
one cluster. Some of the groupings are sparsely populated
areas with only a few thousand inhabitants, while the
boundaries of others encompass several million people. For
the most part, large urban centers under the jurisdiction of
one Local Spiritual Assembly have been designated single
clusters, these in turn being divided into sectors, so as to
facilitate planning and implementation.
With the various countries and territories divided into
manageable areas, national communities moved quickly
ahead to categorize clusters according to the stages of the
development of the Faith mentioned in our 9 January message. The exercise afforded a realistic means for viewing
the prospects of the community, but the task of refining
the criteria needed for valid assessments is proving to be
an ongoing challenge to institutions. To assign a cluster
to one or another category is not to make a statement
about status. Rather, it is a way of evaluating its capacity
for growth, in order that an approach compatible with its
evolving development can be adopted. Rigid criteria are
obviously counterproductive, but a well-defined scheme
to carry out evaluation is essential. Two criteria seem
especially important: the strength of the human resources
raised up by the training institute for the expansion and
consolidation of the Faith in the cluster, and the ability of
the institutions to mobilize these resources in the field of
service.8

40.10

Of course, the stages of growth mentioned in the 9 January
2001 message were defined as follows:

40.12

231

40.11

Turning Point
40.13

The areas into which a region divides will fall into various
categories of development. Some will not yet be open to the
Faith, while others will contain a few isolated localities and
groups; in some, established communities will be gaining
strength through a vigorous institute process; in a few,
strong communities of deepened believers will be in a position to take on the challenges of systematic and accelerated
expansion and consolidation.9

40.13

40.14

Here is how the Universal House of Justice described the
movement of clusters in its 17 January message:

40.14

40.15

In most clusters, movement from one stage of growth
to the next is being defined in terms of the multiplication
of study circles, devotional meetings and children’s classes,
and the expansion they engender. Devotional meetings
begin to flourish as consciousness of the spiritual dimension
of human existence is raised among the believers in an area
through institute courses. Children’s classes, too, are a
natural outgrowth of the training received early in the study
of the main sequence. As both activities are made open to
the wider community through a variety of well-conceived
and imaginative means, they attract a growing number
of seekers, who, more often than not, are eager to attend
firesides and join study circles. Many go on subsequently to
declare their faith in Bahá’u’lláh and, from the outset, view
their role in the community as that of active participants
in a dynamic process of growth. Individual and collective
exertions in the teaching field intensify correspondingly,
further fuelling the process. Established communities are
revitalized, and newly formed ones soon gain the privilege
of electing their Local Spiritual Assemblies.
The coherence thus achieved through the establishment
of study circles, devotional meetings and children’s classes
provides the initial impulse for growth in a cluster, an impulse that gathers strength as these core activities multiply
in number. Campaigns that help a sizeable group of believers advance far enough in the main sequence of courses to
perform the necessary acts of service lend impetus to this
multiplication of activity.10

40.15

40.16

40.17

In this connection, the House of Justice wrote: “The pattern of activity that is being established in clusters around the
globe constitutes a proven means of accelerating expansion and
232

40.16

40.17

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

consolidation.”11 It indicated, however, that this was “only a
beginning”:12
40.18

In many parts of the world, bringing large numbers
into the ranks of Bahá’u’lláh’s followers has traditionally
not been a formidable task. It is therefore encouraging to
see that, in some of the more developed clusters, carefully
designed projects are being added to the existing pattern
of growth to reach receptive populations and lift the rate
of expansion to a higher level. Such projects accelerate the
tempo of teaching, already on the rise through the efforts of
individuals. And, where large-scale enrollment is beginning
to result, provision is being made to ensure that a certain
percentage of the new believers immediately enter the institute program, for, as we have emphasized in several messages, these friends will be called upon to serve the needs of
an ever-growing Bahá’í population. They help deepen the
generality of the Bahá’ís by visiting them regularly; they
teach children, arrange devotional meetings and form study
circles, making it possible to sustain expansion.13

40.18

40.19

The above passage offers insight into how the two movements interact with each other. In essence, one fuels the other,
as explained in the next passage:

40.19

40.20

The challenge is not simply to have a certain percentage
study one or two courses, but a sequence of several courses
through an effective system of distance education. And if
the institute succeeds in accomplishing this, there should be
a corresponding increase in the tempo of the teaching work
as more and more friends arise to serve the Faith. A steady
stream of newly enrolled believers will, in turn, enter the
institute’s program, and in this way the system as a whole
will be in a constant state of expansion.14

40.20

40.21

To maintain the system envisioned at the level of the cluster,
then, the ratio of believers in the sequence of courses to the
total Bahá’í population needs to be kept within a certain range.
Beyond the need to maintain proper ratios, however, there is the
question of tempo. The deployment of believers into the field of
service should lead to an intensification of teaching activities so
that the rate of the expansion of the overall Bahá’í population
steadily accelerates. This, in effect, is the idea underlying an

40.21

233

Turning Point

intensive program of growth, as explained in the 9 January
message of the Universal House of Justice:
40.22

At the core of the program must lie a sound and steady
process of expansion, matched by an equally strong process
of human resource development. A range of teaching
efforts needs to be carried out, involving both activities
undertaken by the individual and campaigns promoted
by the institutions. As the number of believers in the area
rises, a significant percentage should receive training from
the institute, and their capabilities be directed towards the
development of local communities.15

40.22

40.23

What has become clear during the latter part of the Five
Year Plan is that, if such programs are made up of a cycle of
certain activities that is repeated every few months, it is possible to increase the rate of expansion, while at the same time
maintaining the proper ratio of individuals in the sequence of
courses to the total Bahá’í population. The Universal House of
Justice in its Rid.ván 2005 message wrote the following about
such programs:

40.23

40.24

As the necessary conditions have thus been created,
systematic programs for the expansion and consolidation
of the Faith have been launched accordingly. A valuable
body of knowledge about the nature of intensive programs
of growth is accumulating, and certain features of these
endeavors are now well understood. Such programs tend
to consist of a series of cycles, each of several months’
duration, devoted to planning, expansion, and consolidation. Human resource development proceeds uninterrupted
from one cycle to the next, ensuring that the process of
expansion not only is sustained but progressively gathers
momentum. While undoubtedly many more lessons are
still to be garnered, the experience already gained makes
it possible to replicate the approach in an ever-increasing
number of clusters around the world.16

40.24

41
Learning in Action

41.1

41.2

41.3

Referring to the global Plans, a letter written on behalf of the
Universal House of Justice to an individual believer in August
2002 indicated that the challenge before the friends everywhere
is “to study the guidance issued by the House of Justice, on the
one hand, and to learn from experience as they strive to put
that guidance into practice, on the other.”1 A letter written to
another believer not too long before expressed the hope of the
House of Justice that “the general messages it issues from time
to time, as well as its letters that shed light on certain specific
aspects of these new developments, will help the friends to
clarify issues in practice and move steadily toward unity of
thought and action.”2
The above passages suggest that, at a most fundamental
level, the implementation of the global Plans of the Faith is
impelled by learning. Every global Plan represents a stage in
the unfoldment of the Divine Plan, which is leading humanity
towards the world civilization envisioned by Bahá’u’lláh. The
success of each stage of this historical enterprise depends on the
capacity of the Bahá’í community to respond to the provisions
set forth in the global Plan that defines that stage. It is in this
context that the aim of accelerating the process of entry by
troops, which will remain the focus of the global Plans until
2021,
. . . identifies a necessity at this stage in the progress of the
Cause and in the state of human society. With this perspective, the three inseparable participants in the evolution of
the new World Order—the individual, the institutions, and
the community—must now demonstrate more tangibly than
ever before their capacity and willingness to embrace masses
of new adherents, to effect the spiritual and administrative
transformation of thousands upon thousands, and, above
all, to multiply the army of knowledgeable, consecrated
235

41.1

41.2

41.3

Turning Point

teachers of a Faith whose emergence from obscurity must
be registered on the consciousness of countless multitudes
throughout the earth.3
41.4

It is in learning to respond to the requirements of the global
Plans, as set out in the messages of the House of Justice, that
the capacity of the three participants increases. In this sense,
learning is a “mode of operation.” On various occasions, the
House of Justice has explained that this mode of operation is
characterized by action, reflection, and consultation:

41.4

41.5

If learning is to be the primary mode of operation in a community, then visions, strategies, goals and methods have to
be re-examined time and again. As tasks are accomplished,
obstacles removed, resources multiplied and lessons learned,
modifications have to be made in goals and approaches, but
in a way that continuity of action is maintained.4

41.5

41.6

The instrument that has allowed the process of action,
reflection, and consultation to accelerate and the learning to
occur at a fairly rapid rate at the grassroots is the reflection
meeting. In its 17 January 2003 message to the Bahá’ís of the
world, the House of Justice wrote,

41.6

41.7

It is especially gratifying to note the high degree of
participation of believers in the various aspects of the
growth process. In cluster after cluster, the number of those
shouldering the responsibilities of expansion and consolidation is steadily increasing. Meetings of consultation held at
the cluster level serve to raise awareness of possibilities and
generate enthusiasm. Here, free from the demands of formal
decision-making, participants reflect on experience gained,
share insights, explore approaches and acquire a better
understanding of how each can contribute to achieving the
aim of the Plan. In many cases, such interaction leads to
consensus on a set of short-term goals, both individual and
collective. Learning in action is becoming the outstanding
feature of the emerging mode of operation.5

41.7

41.8

What is important is that the experience gained in one part
of the world does not remain isolated from the experiences elsewhere. Through the institution of the Counsellors, the lessons
learned at the grassroots are systematized into a body of knowledge that can help the friends acquire a better understanding of
the dynamics of promoting the process of entry by troops. This

41.8

236

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

knowledge can then be diffused widely by the International
Teaching Centre, the Counsellors and their auxiliaries, stimulating the work at the grassroots and accelerating the learning
process further. The House of Justice has described this aspect
of the Counsellors’ work in the following way:
41.9

A resource made available to the Counsellors by the
International Teaching Centre and through them to the community at large is an accumulating store of wisdom born of
experience—the experience of a highly diverse community
dedicated to the creation of a new civilization. Through
the network of Counsellors, Auxiliary Board members and
assistants, the Teaching Centre can observe the workings
of individual and collective endeavors, analyzing their
methods and approaches, and introducing the conclusions
it draws into the processes of the systematic growth of the
Faith. Thus in the institution of the Counsellors we have a
system through which the lessons learned in the remotest
spots on the globe can be shared with the entire body of the
believers, enriching consultation, stimulating experimentation and inspiring confidence that the great enterprise in
which the Bahá’í world is engaged is assured of success.6

41.9

41.10

It was in this context that the House of Justice wrote to the
Counsellors in 1998:

41.10

41.11

You represent an army of able and highly motivated
servants of the Cause throughout the world. Yours is an
institution which, in one respect, has a particularly intimate
relationship with the Universal House of Justice; in another,
it is able to exercise an influence that penetrates the very
grassroots of the community. Its nature fits it, uniquely, to
serve as a river of encouragement, example and love whose
waters can refresh and invigorate the spirit of every believer
they touch.7

41.11

41.12

In the period covering the Four Year, Twelve Month and
Five Year Plans, as the friends have learned to put into action
the guidance of the Universal House of Justice, the changes
in their habits of thoughts, modes of expression and patterns
of behavior have become so widespread and so pervasive that
there has been a marked shift in culture:

41.12

41.13

Since the outset of the Four Year Plan, the entire Bahá’í
world has been undergoing a profound change in culture

41.13

237

Turning Point

41.14

required by the single focus of the global Plans in this
latter part of the first century of the Faith’s Formative
Age—­advancing the process of entry by troops. It is important that the necessity of this change be fully appreciated
by the friends and that new ideas not be measured by old
modes of thinking, which, while valuable in many respects,
have not been conducive to rapid growth.
When new and challenging ideas emerge, it is inevitable that differences of opinion would arise and levels of
understanding vary. Not infrequently, extremes in thinking
appear. It takes time for habits of thought and modes of expression to change and for patterns of action to be adjusted.
What the Universal House of Justice finds encouraging is
that the institutions of the Faith in . . . are making strides
and are intensely engaged in trying to see how growth
can be accelerated through such elements as study circles,
devotional meetings and children’s classes and that they
can count on wise believers like you to help them in this
essential process.8

41.14

41.15

An important aspect of the change in the culture of Bahá’í
communities worldwide is a collective acknowledgement of
what is needed to bring about entry by troops:

41.15

41.16

The central theme of the Four Year Plan—that of
advancing the process of entry by troops—produced a high
degree of integration of thought and action. . . . The thematic focus of the Plan bore implications for all categories
of Bahá’í activity; it called for a clarity of understanding
which made possible systematic and strategic planning as a
prerequisite of individual and collective action. The members of the community came gradually to appreciate how
systematization would facilitate the processes of growth
and development. This raising of consciousness was a huge
step that led to an upgrading of teaching activities and a
change in the culture of the community.9

41.16

41.17

Collective consciousness of the requisites for advancing
the process of entry by troops has given rise to new ways of
thinking and acting, as the House of Justice explains in a letter
written on its behalf:

41.17

41.18

A remapping of the Bahá’í community through the formation of clusters worldwide is an example of a change which

41.18

238

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

is challenging the community to embrace new ways of
thinking and acting, such as to mobilize a common effort
among local institutions and individual believers that extends across contiguous borders within each cluster. As you
will appreciate, this is a process which necessarily involves
an initial period of adjustment and which will continue to
unfold over a period of time into distinctive features of a
dynamic community that is constantly evolving.10
41.19

As the Bahá’í community develops the habits of learning and
meets the challenges of the Plans, unity of thought and action is
becoming a tangible reality throughout the Bahá’í world.

239

41.19

42
Learning to Be Systematic

42.1

In the Rid.ván 1998 message the Universal House of Justice
called on Bahá’ís to approach their work systematically, referring to systematization as a “necessary mode of functioning
animated by the urgency to act”:

42.1

42.2

Our hopes, our goals, our possibilities of moving
forward can all be realized through concentrating our
endeavors on the major aim of the Divine Plan at its current
stage—that is, to effect a significant advance in the process
of entry by troops. This challenge can be met through persistent effort patiently pursued. Entry by troops is a possibility
well within the grasp of our community. Unremitting faith,
prayer, the promptings of the soul, Divine assistance—these
are among the essentials of progress in any Bahá’í undertaking. But also of vital importance to bringing about entry by
troops is a realistic approach, systematic action. There are
no shortcuts. Systematization ensures consistency of lines
of action based on well-conceived plans. In a general sense,
it implies an orderliness of approach in all that pertains
to Bahá’í service, whether in teaching or administration,
in individual or collective endeavor. While allowing for
individual initiative and spontaneity, it suggests the need to
be clear-headed, methodical, efficient, constant, balanced
and harmonious. Systematization is a necessary mode of
functioning animated by the urgency to act.1

42.2

42.3

The message went on to highlight the essential role that
the training institute plays in systematically developing the
human resources that will sustain and accelerate the expansion
and consolidation of the Faith. In a sense, the development
of human resources can be thought of as the first act of
systematization on the part of Bahá’í communities. This step
was initiated in December 1995 when the House of Justice

42.3

241

Turning Point

introduced the concept of the training institute, related it to the
earlier teaching institute and charged the Counsellors with assisting National Spiritual Assemblies everywhere in establishing
training institutes at the national and regional levels. How this
call for systematization came about is explained succinctly in
the message of 26 December 1995 to the Counsellors:
42.4

42.5

42.6

During the Nine Year Plan, the Universal House
of Justice called upon National Spiritual Assemblies in
countries where large-scale expansion was taking place to
establish teaching institutes to meet the deepening needs
of the thousands who were entering the Faith. At that
time, the emphasis was on acquiring a physical facility to
which group after group of newly enrolled believers would
be invited to attend deepening courses. Over the years, in
conjunction with these institutes, and often independent
of them, a number of courses—referred to, for example,
as weekend institutes, five-day institutes, and nine-day
institutes—were developed for the purpose of helping the
friends gain an understanding of the fundamental verities
of the Faith and arise to serve it. These efforts have contributed significantly to the enriching of the spiritual life of the
believers and will undoubtedly continue in the future.
With the growth in the number of enrollments, it has
become apparent that such occasional courses of instruction and the informal activities of community life, though
important, are not sufficient as a means of human resource
development, for they have resulted in only a relatively
small band of active supporters of the Cause. These believers, no matter how dedicated, no matter how willing to
make sacrifices, cannot attend to the needs of hundreds,
much less thousands, of fledgling local communities.
Systematic attention has to be given by Bahá’í institutions
to training a significant number of believers and assisting
them in serving the Cause according to their God-given
talents and capacities.
The development of human resources on a large scale
requires that the establishment of institutes be viewed in
a new light. In many regions, it has become imperative to
create institutes as organizational structures dedicated to
systematic training. The purpose of such training is to endow ever-growing contingents of believers with the spiritual
insights, the knowledge, and the skills needed to carry out
242

42.4

42.5

42.6

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

the many tasks of accelerated expansion and consolidation,
including the teaching and deepening of a large number
of people—adults, youth and children. This purpose can
best be achieved through well-organized, formal programs
consisting of courses that follow appropriately designed
curricula.2
42.7

An account of the historical developments leading up to
the efforts to establish training institutes worldwide during
the Four Year Plan is discussed in some detail in Chapter 9 of
Century of Light. The chapter offers insight into why human
resource development should have been the first area of Bahá’í
activity to receive systematic attention. It will be helpful to
quote from the document at length.

42.7

42.8

As believers from urban centers set out on sustained
campaigns to reach the mass of the world’s peoples living
in villages and rural areas, they encountered a receptivity to
Bahá’u’lláh’s message far beyond anything they had imagined possible. While the response usually took forms very
different from the ones with which the teachers had been
familiar, the new declarants were eagerly welcomed. . . .
At the heart of the development, as has been the case in
the life of the Cause from the outset, was the commitment
made by the individual believer. Already, during the ministry of Shoghi Effendi, far-sighted persons had taken the
initiative to reach indigenous populations in such countries
as Uganda and Indonesia. During the Nine Year Plan, ever
larger numbers of such teachers were drawn into the work,
particularly in India, several countries in Africa, and most
regions of Latin America, as well as in islands of the Pacific,
Alaska and among the native peoples of Canada and the
rural black population of the southern United States. . . .
Even so, it soon became apparent that individual
initiative alone, however inspired and energetic, could not
respond adequately to the opportunities opening up. The
result was to launch Bahá’í communities on a wide range
of collective teaching and proclamation projects recalling
the heroic days of the dawn-breakers. Teams of ardent
teachers found that it was now possible to introduce the
message of the Faith not merely to a succession of inquirers,
but to entire groups and even whole communities. The tens
of thousands became hundreds of thousands. The Faith’s

42.8

42.9

42.10

243

42.9

42.10

Turning Point

growth meant that members of Spiritual Assemblies, whose
experience had been limited to confirming the understanding of the Faith of individual applicants raised in cultures of
doubt or religious fanaticism, had to adjust to expressions
of belief on the part of whole groups of people to whom
religious awareness and response were normal features of
daily life.3
42.11

The chapter goes on to explain that the large influx of
new believers during the period brought with it unprecedented
challenges, not the least of which were deepening these friends
and adapting to a wide range of cultures and modes of thought.
It then continues by saying,

42.11

42.12

Initially, such problems proved stimulating as both
Bahá’í institutions and individual believers struggled to find
new ways of looking at situations—new ways, indeed, of
understanding important passages in the Bahá’í Writings
themselves. Determined efforts were made to respond
to the guidance of the World Centre that expansion and
consolidation are twin processes that must go hand in
hand. Where hoped for results did not readily materialize,
however, a measure of discouragement frequently set in.
The initial rapid rise in enrollment rates slowed markedly
in many countries, tempting some Bahá’í institutions and
communities to turn back to more familiar activities and
more accessible publics.
The principal effect of the setbacks, however, was
that they brought home to communities that the high
expectations of the early years were in some respects quite
unrealistic. Although the easy successes of the initial teaching activities were encouraging, they did not, by themselves,
build a Bahá’í community life that could meet the needs of
its new members and be self-generating. Rather, pioneers
and new believers alike faced questions for which Bahá’í
experience in Western lands—or even Iran—offered few
answers. How were Local Spiritual Assemblies to be
established—and once established, how were they to
function—in areas where large numbers of new believers
had joined the Cause overnight, simply on the strength of
their spiritual apprehension of its truth? How, in societies
dominated by men since the dawn of time, were women
to be accorded an equal voice? How was the education of

42.12

42.13

244

42.13

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

42.14

large numbers of children to be systematically addressed in
cultural situations where poverty and illiteracy prevailed?
What priorities should guide Bahá’í moral teaching, and
how could these objectives best be related to prevailing
indigenous conventions? How could a vibrant community
life be cultivated that would stimulate the spiritual growth
of its members? What priorities, too, should be set with
respect to the production of Bahá’í literature, particularly
given the sudden explosion that had taken place in the
number of languages represented in the community? How
could the integrity of the Bahá’í institution of the Nineteen
Day Feast be maintained, while opening this vital activity
to the enriching influence of diverse cultures? And, in all
areas of concern, how were the necessary resources to be
recruited, funded, and coordinated?
The pressure of these urgent and interlocking challenges
launched the Bahá’í world on a learning process that has
proved to be as important as the expansion itself. It is safe
to say that during these years there was virtually no type of
teaching activity, no combination of expansion, consolidation and proclamation, no administrative option, no effort
at cultural adaptation that was not being energetically
tried in some part of the Bahá’í world. The net result of the
experience was an intensive education of a great part of the
Bahá’í community in the implications of the mass teaching
work, an education that could have occurred in no other
way. By its very nature, the process was largely local and
regional in focus, qualitative rather than quantitative in its
gains, and incremental rather than large-scale in the progress achieved. Had it not been for the painstaking, always
difficult and often frustrating consolidation work pursued
during these years, however, the subsequent strategy of
systematizing the promotion of entry by troops would have
had very little with which to work.4

42.14

42.15

This learning process took three decades to come to fruition. Century of Light describes the significance of this period
in Bahá’í history:

42.15

42.16

The significance of these three decades of struggle,
learning and sacrifice became apparent when the moment
arrived to devise a global Plan that would capitalize on the
insights gained and the resources that had been developed.

42.16

245

Turning Point

The Bahá’í community that set out on the Four Year Plan
in 1996 was a very different one from the eager, but new
and still inexperienced body of believers who, in 1964, had
ventured out on the first of such undertakings that were
no longer sustained by the guiding hand of Shoghi Effendi.
By 1996, it had become possible to see all of the distinct
strands of the enterprise as integral parts of one coherent
whole.5
42.17

At the outset of the Four Year Plan, then, the Bahá’í world
was able to capitalize on the insights it had gained during the
preceding period as it focused on establishing a network of
training institutes as a means of systematizing the work in the
area of expansion and consolidation. Laying this foundation
was the first act of systematization. Through it mechanisms
were put in place to develop the human resources of the Faith.
In its message of 26 November 1999 to the Bahá’ís of the
world, the House of Justice praised the accomplishments that
were achieved putting this network into place and alluded to
the next area of Bahá’í activity to receive systematic attention,
starting with the Twelve Month Plan:

42.17

42.18

It is essential that, during the one-year effort, national
and regional institutes everywhere bring into full operation
the programs and systems that they have now devised.
National communities should enter the Five Year Plan confident that the acquisition of knowledge, qualities and skills
of service by large contingents of believers, with the aid
of a sequence of courses, will proceed unhindered. Ample
attention must also be given to further systematization of
teaching efforts, whether undertaken by the individual or
directed by the institutions. In this respect, the International
Teaching Centre has identified certain patterns of systematic
expansion and consolidation for relatively small geographical areas consisting of a manageable number of localities.6

42.18

42.19

A letter dated 31 July 2002 written on behalf of the House of
Justice to an individual believer described what this systemization entailed in concrete terms:

42.19

42.20

With institutes well positioned to address the challenges
of human resource development, the stage was set to further
systematize the teaching efforts worldwide. In its 9 January
2001 message regarding the Five Year Plan, the Universal

42.20

246

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

House of Justice asked that this systemization take place
in the context of a “cluster”—a small geographic area that
would enable the friends to think about the growth of the
Faith on a manageable scale and to design and implement
plans close to the grassroots of the community. As a first
step in the execution of the Plan, Bahá’í institutions set out
to map their countries with the aim of dividing them into
clusters and categorizing them according to their current
stage of development. Invariably, this undertaking served
to galvanize the believers, for they were able to evaluate
in realistic terms their strengths and weaknesses and to see
with striking clarity a way forward. The resulting plans of
action were thus able to envision the systematic deployment
of the avowed supporters of the Faith, whose ranks were
swelling through the efforts of the institute, to establish
a pattern of growth based on three core activities—study
circles, devotional meetings and children’s classes. As this
pattern has unfolded in clusters around the world, an
increasing number are gradually reaching the stage where
they are ready to launch intensive programs for the expansion and consolidation of the Faith.7
42.21

42.22

42.23

As indicated above, the concept of the cluster was introduced at the beginning of the Five Year Plan to assist in
the systematization of teaching. Once communities had been
divided into clusters, the institutions of the Faith were challenged to learn how to effectively deploy the human resources
being generated by the training institute in the field of service.
In this way, the systematization of teaching efforts, and before
it of human resource development, has been a central feature of
the global Plans of the Faith since the Four Year Plan.
And as the friends and institutions have proceeded earnestly
along the path traced out by the Universal House of Justice,
they have begun to internalize and integrate the lessons and
experiences of systemization called for in the global Plans. They
have come to realize, for instance, that an essential requirement
of systematic action is to arrive at a unified vision of growth for
their communities and regions. The House of Justice has noted
in the statement “The Institution of the Counsellors,”
At the outset of the work of the year or at times when
new plans are being formulated, it is often useful to arrange
for consultations between the Auxiliary Board members and
247

42.21

42.22

42.23

Turning Point

the National or Regional Teaching Committees or Regional
Councils before these plans are given final definition. A
highly fruitful practice has developed in many parts of the
world whereby members of a number of institutions and
agencies of a country, or a region thereof, come together in
a meeting of consultation to reach a common vision for the
growth of their community and discuss strategies for action. These “institutional meetings” help to steer the friends
away from thinking merely in terms of the mechanics of
projects and to infuse their plans and subsequent action
with the spirit of the Faith. They do much to reinforce the
confidence of the institutions in devising the teaching strategies that will best serve the needs of their respective regions
and in mobilizing the support of the Local Assemblies and
the believers.8
42.24

Further, it is becoming clearer, especially among Auxiliary
Board members and their assistants, that a vision for the growth
of a cluster or region can only emerge from a far-greater vision
of such realities as the greatness of this Day, the power of divine
assistance, the potential inherent in every human being, and the
powers that become available to the believers when they truly
unite and work in a spirit of oneness:

42.24

42.25

To labor in the arena of service, the individual draws upon
his love for Bahá’u’lláh, the power of the Covenant, the
dynamics of prayer, the inspiration and education derived
from regular study of the Holy Texts, and the transformative forces that operate upon his soul as he strives to
behave in accordance with the divine laws and principles.
Therefore, these are all themes of an ongoing relationship
between the Auxiliary Board members and the believers.9

42.25

42.26

Evolving a vision of growth, it is being recognized, is fundamentally a spiritual process, one that implies ever-increasing
consciousness of the spiritual forces released by Bahá’u’lláh.
What is more, the friends everywhere are coming to the understanding that, in developing a vision of growth and the strategies to bring structure to it, some knowledge of possibilities,
resources and even methods is necessary. A natural consequence
has been the increasing number of concrete plans of action that
“take into account the particular resources of the believers”
and “the capacity of the local Bahá’í communities.”10

42.26

248

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts
42.27

In this connection, the believers and their institutions have
also taken to heart the admonition of the House of Justice that
progress “cannot be achieved by a mere series of spasmodic,
uncoordinated exertions, no matter how enthusiastic”11 and
have learned the value of continuity of action. The concept of
a line of action has proven particularly helpful in this respect.
The House of Justice has explained in the context of intensive
programs of growth: “The best approach is to formulate
plans for a few months at a time, beginning with one or two
lines of action and gradually growing in complexity.”12 A
line of action consists of a sequence of projects and activities,
each building on the previous one and preparing the way for
further advances. In this light, the role of periodic meetings of
consultation to “reflect on issues, consider adjustments, and
maintain enthusiasm and unity of thought”13 has been crucial
to the friends’ efforts to pursue lines of action and build on
their accomplishments:

42.27

42.28

Arrangements can then be made for the lessons learned
from this experience to be discussed with the active supporters of the Faith in each region, helping them to identify
the approaches and methods applicable to their specific
conditions and to set in motion a systematic process of
community development. This process should be one in
which the friends review their successes and difficulties,
adjust and improve their methods accordingly, and learn,
and move forward unhesitatingly.14

42.28

42.29

Towards the end of the Five Year Plan, this guidance finally
gave rise to the organization of intensive programs of growth in
terms of cycles of growth, a matter which is currently the object
of learning in cluster after cluster as an increasing number
around the world reach this stage in their development. The
following passage from a letter dated 19 October 2005 written
to one National Spiritual Assembly summarizes the overall
learning to date:

42.29

42.30

The promising pattern of action emerging in clusters
throughout the world integrates individual initiative and
community endeavor in order to embrace an ever-wider
circle of people and teach receptive souls. This pattern
appears wherever a sizeable number of individuals who
are moving through the sequence of institute courses make

action, undertaking specific acts of service that challenge
them to draw upon the knowledge and insights they are
gaining and to sharpen the skills and abilities they are developing through the courses. One of the most noteworthy
outcomes of the institute courses is the emergence of an
ever-increasing number of tutors who, having themselves
studied the courses and struggled to walk a path of service,
engage others in the study of the sequence, instilling in them
the same desire to arise and serve. In this way, a broad base
is laid for universal participation, which remains one of
the most fundamental goals of the Bahá’í community. You
have, yourselves, witnessed this development in the few
clusters that have reached an advanced stage of growth.
You have, likewise, observed how the conditions thus
created in such clusters have made it possible to launch
intensive programs of growth, in which large numbers of
friends eagerly participate in the learning that takes place
through successive cycles of activity seeking to integrate
well-coordinated collective action with effective individual
initiative. And you are equally aware of how interaction
among three entities—the institute, the Auxiliary Boards,
and the Area Teaching Committee—in close collaboration
with responsive Local Spiritual Assemblies, can help carry
the friends from one cycle to another and accelerate the
learning process.15

42.31

42.32

And the passage below written to another National Assembly
points to some of the challenges ahead:

42.32

42.33

The pattern of activity that emerges from one cycle of the
program to the next will, however, prove effective only if
the tendency to fall into certain habits is avoided. Among
these are an undue reliance on proclamation efforts in the
intensive teaching phase; a proliferation of core activities
that does not serve the purpose of involving a growing
number of seekers; a disproportionate focus on increasing short-lived contacts that loses sight of the need to
systematically teach those who have shown interest in the
Faith; and an overemphasis on the administrative activities
occupying veteran Bahá’ís as enthusiastic new believers are
being introduced to the disciplines and functions of the
community.

42.33

250

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts
42.34

42.35

To ensure the successful unfoldment of the process
of action and reflection that should run throughout the
successive cycles, the friends will want to keep at least
two points in mind. First, having dedicated an enormous
amount of time and energy towards studying a sequence
of courses aimed at helping them carry out certain acts of
service, they should now strive to apply what they have
learned in the teaching field. Specifically, if the content of
the courses explores fundamental concepts related to direct
teaching, it is only natural that they would seek to translate
these into action. If a home visit, to take another example,
is defined in the courses as an opportunity to enter into a
deep conversation on spiritual matters, then it should not
be reduced to a mere social call in which the Faith may not
even be mentioned. In short, the educational process in
which the friends have engaged over so many weeks and
months should give shape to the individual and collective
activities they now undertake.
Second, the meetings of reflection called at various
intervals during the cycles should serve to reinforce an
attitude of learning among the participants in the program
so that any fear of failure or criticism gives way to the joy
of earnest striving. To achieve this, the friends involved
in organizing the meetings should recognize that guided,
participatory discussion can prove more instructive than
elaborate presentations and prolonged theoretical analyses.
A careful review of vital statistics, which highlight weaknesses that require remedial attention and point to strengths
that can be built upon in the next cycle of activity, will go
far in facilitating the planning process.16

Learning to Maintain Focus

43.1

43.2

For a twenty-five year period, from 1996 to 2021, the Bahá’í
world will focus its attention on one single aim, that is, “on
advancing the process of entry by troops and on its systematic acceleration.”1 First introduced in the message dated
26 December 1995 to the Conference of the Continental Boards
of Counsellors, this aim has required believers and their institutions to exercise a higher degree of discipline in their individual
and collective activities than previously called for. “There will
be challenges to face, difficulties to overcome and adjustments
to be made,”2 the Universal House of Justice cautioned one
National Spiritual Assembly at the beginning of the Four Year
Plan in 1996. What would be important, the House of Justice
indicated, was for the institutions and the believers to set out
towards the realization of this aim in a “spirit of unity.”3
Maintaining focus has proven to be one of the greatest
challenges to individuals and institutions in this regard. A letter
written to the National Assembly of Kenya explained,

43.1

43.2

43.3

To help large numbers of believers go through a sequence
of courses is a formidable task, involving systematic work
with an increasing number of tutors, the establishment of
study circles, and measures for monitoring the progress
of the participants. The friends in charge of the process
need to have clarity of vision and should be allowed to
carry out their mission without distraction. To assign to
the institute such tasks as visiting communities and helping
Local Spiritual Assemblies in their functioning would only
lead to confusion.4

43.3

43.4

The House of Justice advised one National Assembly in 1998
that

43.4

43.5

. . . the time has come for attention to be focused on the
task of raising up human resources for the work of the

43.5

253

Turning Point

43.6

Faith from among the believers in the [Dananè] region
itself. If this implies that for some time the geographic
expansion of the Faith through the opening of new localities has to come to a halt, it is entirely understandable. It
would also be acceptable for the rate of expansion—that
is, the number of fresh recruits—to drop dramatically for a
period as a balanced process of expansion and consolidation is allowed to gather momentum. What is needed at this
stage is to gradually expand the institute’s coverage so that
the many capable friends in the region can have access to
a systematic program of training aimed at enhancing their
capacity to perform the tasks that an accelerated process of
growth demands.
Herein now lies the priority not only for Dananè, but
for other regions of the country as well. A constant barrage of new activities and projects in the region, no matter
how well-intentioned, will only distract attention away
from this all-important task. An endless stream of invitations to individuals from other countries to participate in
projects that are not well rooted in the community itself is
counterproductive.5

43.6

43.7

These passages suggest that having an aim implies understanding that certain activities take precedence over others and
that certain steps must precede others. “At various stages in the
evolution of the Faith,” a letter to an individual has indicated,
“certain activities that assist with the pressing needs of the
development of the Bahá’í community may receive emphasis
in a particular global plan. The institute process is one such
example and is concerned with raising up the needed human
resources for this stage in the growth of the Faith.”6 It is clear,
then, that not all activities have the same importance at a given
stage of development. Some activities, while perhaps suitable at
a later stage, will only serve as distractions at the present one.
Such activities may divert human and financial resources away
from pressing tasks and impede progress. One of the requisites
of having an aim is to maintain a “clear vision of the steps”7
that must be taken at each stage in order to reach it.

43.7

43.8

It took time, of course, for the friends to arrive at such an
understanding. First it was necessary for them to realize that
certain kinds of activities undertaken during previous Plans
would not contribute to their aim. In the following passage

43.8

254

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

National Assemblies in Southeast Asia were advised early in the
Four Year Plan against implementing a large-scale collaborative
effort:
43.9

The Universal House of Justice does not wish to
discourage you in your endeavors. Nor should you feel
that the efforts of those communities with more resources
at their disposal to assist their sister communities are not
appreciated. Yet there is so much to be achieved in each one
of your countries, if the central aim of the Four Year Plan is
to be realized, that you should be wary of introducing any
extraneous regional projects, losing thereby focus on the
execution of national plans.8

43.9

43.10

The friends and the institutions also came to realize they
should guard against making their work overly complex:

43.10

43.11

What is most important in Belarus at this stage is to
develop a national institute program, which initially need
not be complex, and to have a group of trained teachers
who offer courses on a regular basis in different localities
throughout the country.9

43.11

43.12

They began to see that “there is little need for lengthy and
frequent consultations to set direction and devise and rethink
fundamental plans”10 and that they should avoid “excessive
emphasis on the perfection of methods.”11 It became clear to
them that “to train scores of facilitators in how to conduct the
first few courses, so that they [could] offer them in the villages
and towns throughout the country” was a formidable task that
would “require tremendous focus and concentration.”12
And as Bahá’ís devoted increasing attention to establishing
training institutes for the development of human resources,
they gradually understood that this step had implications for
how they arranged their priorities, addressed other needs, and
allocated resources:

43.12

43.13

43.14

In the area of human resource development the most
pressing need in Australia now is for the extension of
institute programs across the entire country, as stated in
our letter of 2 December 1998. The accomplishment of this
vital objective will require a substantial expenditure of the
limited resources available to you, as well as a concentration of effort. The Bahá’í Centers of Learning in each State
will need to be strengthened and a sustained endeavor
255

43.13

43.14

Turning Point

43.15

carried out, in collaboration with the Counsellors and the
Auxiliary Board members, to encourage the rank and file of
the Australian Bahá’í community to participate in institute
programs. The challenge before you is that of transforming
the culture of the Bahá’í community to one of continual
learning together with application of the Bahá’í teachings
in activities designed to advance the interests of the Faith.
Giving priority to meeting this need does not mean
that other initiatives which meet special needs or interests
should be neglected. However, it does mean that the growth
of such ventures should be restricted to such a degree as not
to require an appreciable expenditure of the funds of the
Faith.13

43.15

43.16

The friends also came to understand that even the most wellintentioned proposals could cause them to lose focus:

43.16

43.17

You seek guidance on the advisability of your distributing a deepening program to all Regional Bahá’í Councils
for use by the friends, especially newly enrolled believers,
in small groups or individually. It is, of course, important
for deepening courses and study classes to flourish in local
communities everywhere, and your desire to facilitate the
multiplication of such activities is appreciated. Nonetheless,
what you are suggesting would, in essence, constitute a
national program that could distract the friends from the
institute process and ultimately undermine the hard-earned
progress that your community has achieved in recent years
in that process.14

43.17

43.18

As appreciation for the work of the training institute grew, the
friends eventually realized that it could not be used to address
every need if it was to fulfill its purpose:

43.18

43.19

The House of Justice appreciates that there is a pressing need to continue to raise the awareness of the Bahá’í
community concerning the significance of the Law of
H
. uqúqu’lláh. However, as you know, training institutes
have been established as a means of developing human
resources for the expansion and consolidation of the Faith.
Naturally, the Law of H
. uqúqu’lláh will have an appropriate
place in a sequence of courses offered by an institute, as will
the whole question of supporting the funds of the Faith. But
to involve the training institutes in a specific endeavor to

43.19

256

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

educate the friends in this Law would be a diversion from
their main task. The Universal House of Justice feels that
other means should be used for this purpose, for example,
deepening sessions, seminars and occasional workshops.15
43.20

It also became clear with time that the work of the training
institute could not accommodate every individual initiative:

43.20

43.21

The House of Justice appreciates the sentiments of
devotion and dedication that animate the messages from
Mrs. . . . and her daughter. Regarding the introduction and
guidelines for “story circles,” in general, the House of Justice
has no comment to make about the approach promoted by
Mrs. . . . for sharing stories. However, as various institutes
around the world, including the one serving . . . , strive to
establish the concept of study circles, care should be taken
to avoid attaching too many extraneous elements to it. The
potential for complication is especially evident in this case
where the “story circle” is intended to evolve into a study
circle.16

43.21

43.22

And, most important, the friends learned that focus would
require perseverance:

43.22

43.23

By focusing the friends’ attention on only two goals
over the past year, you were able to make considerable
advances in the establishment of ongoing training courses
in both Yap and Palau, although in terms of the numerical
growth of your community progress was negligible. Yet,
you should not be discouraged. In the planning and execution of any set of activities, it is important to make sure that
expectations are not raised unreasonably high. In the case
of your institute program, those who have participated will
have completed only the first course or two. If, as you say in
your annual report, the results have been a firm acceptance
of Bahá’í identity and heightened enthusiasm for service,
then you should be heartened by your achievements.
It is therefore imperative that you continue to vigorously pursue your plans to establish a training institute in
each island group. Every effort should be made to expand
the system for the delivery of courses so that more and
more friends are able to enter your institute program.
You should also make sure that many advance far enough
along in the program to study courses directly designed to

43.23

43.24

257

43.24

Turning Point

increase their capacity to teach and to guide new souls to
Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation.17
43.25

As the Five Year Plan opened, the question of deploying
­human resources in the context of clusters assumed prominence. “Concentrated and sustained attention”18 was now
focused on two movements. The concept of setting priorities
was well understood by then, and most national communities
soon identified two or three clusters “on which to focus special
attention.”19 The House of Justice referred to the prioritization
of clusters in its Rid.ván 2004 message:

43.25

43.26

National Assemblies, while attending to the needs of all
the clusters in their countries, have learned the value of
concentrating special attention on certain priority clusters
that show high promise, encouraging and developing them
until the human resources they have raised up through the
training institutes enable them to become centers of rapid,
sustained growth.20

43.26

43.27

During this period National Assemblies were better able
to distinguish activities that would contribute to the aim of
the Plan from those which should be taken up at a later stage.
It was in this light that the National Assembly of the Russian
Federation was commended for its decision to forgo the
implementation of a program related to social and economic
development on a national scale:

43.27

43.28

The House of Justice noted with interest that the
modules of the “My Home” program, prepared by the
now defunct European Family Life Task Force, were well
received by the believers and their friends in Russia. It
is understood that, based on the recommendations of
the Counsellors, a decision was made to suspend the
implementation of this program, so that the limited human
resources in your stronger clusters could pay adequate
attention to the requirements of systematic expansion and
consolidation. You should rest assured that your decision is
well in keeping with the oft-repeated guidance of the House
of Justice regarding the need to focus on the priorities of
the Plan. The welcome acceleration of activities in several
clusters in recent months, leading to the launching of two
intensive programs of growth in Moscow and Ulan-Ude, is
a clear vindication of your approach. As your communities

43.28

258

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

expand and capacities increase, the institutions will be in a
better position to assess the nature of social and economic
development projects that need to be introduced.21
43.29

National Assemblies were helped to see how other types of
activities related to the work of expansion and consolidation,
on which the generality of the friends have been focused. For
example, one Assembly was advised that

43.29

43.30

The work of external affairs represents a very specialized
field of service and is most commonly performed by a small
group of believers in a national community. There is no
reason to see it in competition with the activities of the generality of the friends for the expansion and consolidation
of the Faith, vying, for example, for the human resources
engaged in the teaching work and the institute process. It
is suggested that you review the enclosed statement and,
on that basis, adopt one or two lines of action that can be
carried out by a small corps of believers with capacity in
this area. As your experience increases over time, you can
gradually expand the range of your endeavors in the field
of external affairs.22

43.30

43.31

In this way, National Assemblies in Europe were counseled
that the external affairs work “makes no widespread demand
on the community, nor does it detract from, but is an essential
contribution to, the processes of the Five Year Plan.”23 In addition to external affairs, the House of Justice would indicate that
activities in other areas should be conducted within the context
of the Plans. A letter written on its behalf acknowledging receipt
of several reports on a conference of “young Bahá’ís interested
in serious study of the Writings”24 suggested the following:

43.31

43.32

There certainly is great value in the initiative taken by
individuals to engage in scholarly study of the Writings for
its own sake; however, a greater value accrues to both the
individual and the community when the motive for such
study is prompted by a desire to serve the aim of the Plan
in progress and, consequently, if relevant activities, such as
the recent conference, are designed within the context of
the Plan.25

43.32

43.33

In some instances, even the question of the purchase of
properties should be addressed with the aim of the Plan in
mind:

43.33

259

Turning Point
43.34

The House of Justice appreciates the desire of the friends
to have a suitably located Bahá’í Center and recognizes the
need for a reception center to serve both the friends in the
metropolitan area and visitors from abroad. It feels, however, that the purchase of a building would not be appropriate at this juncture. Beside any financial considerations, the
dispersed pattern of activity in the intensive program of
growth now unfolding in London will undoubtedly influence future perceptions of the type of facilities required.26

43.34

43.35

There is clearly an increasing awareness among the friends
of the need to maintain focus on the aim of advancing the
process of entry by troops. They are beginning to see that the
most effective way to pursue this aim is within the framework
of the global Plans of the Faith. It is worth remembering in this
regard how tenuous such focus can be and how easily it is lost.
The following was recently written to one National Assembly:

43.35

43.36

. . . the plans for the teaching project adopted by the
Spiritual Assembly appear to revert to a teaching mode that
was used in the past and which proved not to be a sustainable approach to expansion and consolidation. Therefore,
the House of Justice urges you to immediately consult with
the Counsellors about finding ways to recast the project to
bring it more closely into conformity with the priorities of
the Five Year Plan.27

43.36

43.37

Of course, since the outset of the Four Year Plan there have
been believers, some with the noblest of intentions, who have
preferred to focus on other pursuits. In this regard it seems
that the House of Justice has been anxious that they not feel
compelled to do otherwise. One individual who wrote to the
House of Justice to raise concerns about the format and content
of study circles was offered the following in reply:

43.37

43.38

It is natural that any given educational program would
not appeal to everyone, and clearly participating in the
courses of an institute is not a requirement to be fulfilled
by all believers. In no way, then, should those who do not
wish to take part feel that they are disobeying the directives
of the Universal House of Justice. It does ask, however, that
everyone, even those not involved, support the institute
process and not impede its steady progress.28

43.38

260

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts
43.39

Another individual who expressed discomfort about the multiplication of core activities received this reply:

43.39

43.40

You indicate that, despite your personal disapproval of
the materials being used by institutes in . . . , you feel under
an obligation to continue focusing your efforts on the core
activities of the present Plan. The House of Justice believes
that, given your views, there is no reason for you to feel
such an obligation, and you are advised to determine, in the
privacy of your own conscience, those ways in which you
can most effectively serve the advancement of the Cause.29

43.40

43.41

Oftentimes the reason given for not wanting to participate
in the core activities is a feeling that the focus of the Bahá’í
world is giving rise to uniformity. This concern has been addressed in letters written on behalf of the House of Justice such
as the following:

43.41

43.42

The House of Justice feels that you need to consider this
issue in the larger context of the development of the training institute as an element essential to the growth of the
Faith, beginning with the Four Year Plan. Given the nature
of this agency and the purpose defined for it by the House
of Justice, it goes without saying that the emerging training
institutes around the world would choose a sequence of
courses and offer them to the friends in the territories they
respectively serve. To have a large number of believers
engaged in the study of these courses, far from a sign of
uniformity, is part of the natural dynamics of a successful
educational program. That at this point in the development
of the Bahá’í community a significant percentage of the
training institutes worldwide have opted to initiate their activities with a set of materials that has proven itself effective
over many years of experience is a welcome phenomenon.
. . . the House of Justice feels that it would be beneficial
for you to separate in your mind the training institute
process, so intimately connected with the promotion of
large-scale expansion and consolidation, from the many
deepening classes, workshops and summer school courses
that form a fundamental part of Bahá’í community life.
Their number and diversity actually seem to be on the
rise as a result of the institute process. Indeed, you will be
reassured to know that, as the believers gain confidence
in their capacity to serve through the institute process, a

43.42

43.43

261

43.43

Turning Point

much richer expression of the diverse talents of the friends
is beginning to appear in the Bahá’í world—a richness that
bodes well for the future progress of the Cause.30
43.44

Clearly, the unity of thought and action that results from
maintaining focus is not to be confused with uniformity. The
framework of the Five Year Plan—“a Plan designed to fit the
requirements of these times”31—provides ample room for the
exercise of individual initiative as well as collective action.
Within this framework the friends are encouraged to carry out
activities “aimed at advancing the process of entry by troops.”32
Each individual believer must decide for him or herself how to
participate in this global enterprise. What is important is that
his or her endeavors not go so far “beyond what the House of
Justice had in mind when writing of encouraging individual
initiative”33 that they shatter focus and disrupt the work of the
Plan. In this sense, by learning to work within the framework of
the global Plans the friends are coming to a better understanding of how to contribute to the greater good. “The spirit of the
approach to systematic programs of growth,” a letter written
on behalf of the House of Justice advised, “is that of believers
working together effectively for the common good.”34 And
another letter to an individual believer offered the following
guidance:

43.44

43.45

Ultimately, the choice fruits of one’s striving are
manifested in selfless service to the Cause, surrendering all
personal interests and desires for the things that pertain
unto God, subordinating one’s will to the common good
and ever mindful of the pitfall of attachment to one’s own
service.35

43.45

43.46

And as institutions at all levels help the friends “to maintain
a unity of vision”36 and carry out individual and collective
activities within the framework of the Plans, the believers are
witnessing first hand what it means for their powers to be
“multiplied in unified action”:37

43.46

43.47

It would simplify and unify the efforts of the entire community if the friends would earnestly strive to follow the few
but essential guidelines given for the operation of the Five
Year Plan. The House of Justice has no doubt whatever that
such strivings would intensify the dynamics for achieving
entry by troops on an ever-widening scale.38

43.47

Learning to Develop Human Resources
for Expansion and Consolidation

44.1

In its Rid.ván 2000 message, the Universal House of Justice stated that “the system of training institutes established throughout
the world with great rapidity” qualified as “the single greatest
legacy of the Four Year Plan” in the field of expansion and
consolidation.1 Several months earlier in its 26 November 1999
message to the Bahá’ís of the world, the House of Justice had
described this achievement in the following terms:

44.1

44.2

The accomplishments during this period are encouraging indeed. An impressive network of training institutes on
a scale but dimly imagined at the start of the Plan has been
established throughout the world. These nascent centers of
learning have made significant strides in developing formal
programs and in putting into place effective systems for the
delivery of courses. Reports indicate that the number of believers benefiting directly from training courses has climbed
to nearly 100,000. Without question, the capacity of the
worldwide community to develop its human resources has
been distinctly enhanced.
The effects of this systematic approach to human resource development are making themselves felt in the lives
of all three protagonists of the Plan—the individual believer,
the institutions, and the local community. There has been
an upsurge in teaching activities undertaken at the initiative
of the individual. Spiritual Assemblies, Councils, and committees have grown in their ability to guide the believers in
their individual and collective endeavors. And community
life has flourished, even in localities long dormant, as new
patterns of thought and behavior have emerged.2

44.2

In this light, the House of Justice made the following remarks
at the outset of the Five Year Plan in 2001 regarding the effects

44.4

44.3

44.4

263

44.3

Turning Point

of the institute on the individual, institutions, and community
and its continued importance in the work of the Cause:
44.5

A searching analysis of the Four Year Plan recently
prepared for us by the International Teaching Centre
demonstrates that the training institute is effective not
only in enhancing the powers of the individual, but also
in vitalizing communities and institutions. The continued
development of training institutes in the diverse countries
and territories of the world, then, must be a central feature
of the new Plan.3

44.5

44.6

The training institute has been defined by the House
of Justice as an agency of the National Spiritual Assembly
“charged with the task of developing human resources in all
or part of country.”4 A letter written on behalf of the House
of Justice explained that the growth of the Faith depends on a
systematic process of human resource development:

44.6

44.7

In its message of 26 December 1995 to the Conference of
the Continental Boards of Counsellors, the House of Justice
clearly explained that occasional courses of instruction and
the informal activities of community life, though important,
had not proven sufficient as a means of human resource
development. It indicated further that a systematic process
for the development of human resources was essential to
the sustained large-scale expansion of the Faith. To conceive and nurture an educational process of the magnitude
envisioned by the Universal House of Justice is vastly
different than thinking about one’s own interests, which is
not to say that personal study and spiritual growth are not
legitimate and natural concerns of the individual.5

44.7

44.8

Creating the capacity within each national community to
establish and administer such an educational process required
an enormous amount of effort and a high degree of discipline
on the part of the institutions of the Faith during the Four Year
Plan. The Spiritual Assembly of Thailand was counseled at the
start of the Plan:

44.8

44.9

Those engaged in this area of service—whether as teachers, coordinators, or members of the institute’s board—will
have to realize that there is much to be learned. How to
offer the courses and how to attract the believers to them,
which courses to offer at a central location and which ones

44.9

264

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

to conduct in the towns and villages—these are among the
many questions to which they will have to seek answers.
They should never lose heart when difficulties appear, but
should persevere in their endeavors, for only in this way
will the institute acquire the capacity to develop the human
resources of the Thai community.6
44.10

44.11

44.12

The methodology to be adopted in creating this capacity,
the House of Justice advised, was one of action, reflection, and
consultation. It encouraged the friends involved to approach
their tasks with “an open attitude towards learning,” fully
cognizant of the need to “make decisions” about the work of
the institute, “to implement them, to reflect on the results, and
to make adjustments in the light of experience”7 “Through
such an approach,” the House of Justice assured one National
Assembly, “your institute will succeed in gradually increasing its
capacity to develop the human resources”8 of the community.
In this sense, in calling for the establishment of training
institutes for the development of human resources, the House of
Justice was also asking the Bahá’í world to learn what it means
to work in a learning mode. And as the friends everywhere entered into this mode, they gradually came to better understand
the nature of the institute and how to go about establishing it.
“It is important to realize that the development of the institute
in your national community, like everywhere else,” it has been
explained, “is a dynamic process in which all those involved
gradually reach higher and higher levels of understanding as
to the nature of the process itself.”9 The fact that the Bahá’í
community worldwide has acquired a vocabulary necessary to
speak on the subject indicates how successful it was both in
creating capacity for developing human resources, on the one
hand, and in adopting a posture of learning in all its affairs, on
the other. Words and phrases such as “study circle,” “sequence
of courses,” “institute campaigns,” and “practice” are now
commonplace. To speak about a “pyramid of human resources”
or a “system of distance education” evokes a practical set of
ideas in the minds of Bahá’ís everywhere. It is well understood
by all when the training institute is referred to as the “engine
for growth.”
To reach this point required learning in two principal
areas: in the nature of programs for the development of human resources and in the system for their delivery. This was

265

44.10

44.11

44.12

Turning Point

underscored in the message dated 9 January 2001 from the
House of Justice:
44.13

Drawing on the wealth of experience now accumulated
in this area of endeavor, institutes will have to provide their
communities with a constant stream of human resources
to serve the process of entry by troops. Elements of a
system that can meet the training needs of large numbers
of believers have already been tested worldwide and have
proven themselves. Study circles, reinforced by extension
courses and special campaigns, have shown their ability to
lend structure to the process of spiritual education at the
grassroots. The value of a sequence of courses, each one
following the other in a logical pattern and each one building on the achievements of the previous ones, has become
abundantly clear.10

44.13

44.14

As indicated in the above passage, it took time to come to
an understanding of the role of a properly structured sequence
of courses in enhancing the friends’ capabilities of service. The
document “Training Institutes,” prepared for and approved by
the House of Justice, had advised that “the complexity of the
task of defining each sequence and elaborating the materials”
should not be underestimated.11 In this respect, many National
Assemblies felt that the wisest course of action was “to make a
start, using the tried and tested sequence of course materials”
already available because of the pressing need to move forward.12 It was in the light of such considerations that eventually
more and more National Assemblies decided that their training
institutes should adopt the materials of the Ruhi Institute for
their courses:

44.14

44.15

When the concept of the training institute was introduced
by the House of Justice, it left National Spiritual Assemblies
free to adopt whatever kind of systematic training they
felt best suited to their countries. Quite rapidly, however,
it became evident, through experience, that the courses of
the Ruhi Institute, developed over many years in Colombia,
were far more effective than any other generally available.
Some believers who did not have the experience of using
the courses were of the opinion that they were too “elementary” for the people of their country, but, in one country
after another, the Ruhi Institute courses have proved their
effectiveness in virtually every environment. The House

44.15

266

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

of Justice has still not limited National Assemblies in
their choice of institute courses, but it has been pleased
to note how most National Assemblies have recognized
the effectiveness of the Ruhi Institute’s main sequence of
courses and have put it to full use—a use that in due time
will enable them to develop additional materials suited to
their specific environments, that supplement the books of
the Ruhi Institute.13
44.16

44.17

44.18

Though born out of the experience of the Bahá’í community of Colombia in large-scale expansion and consolidation,
the materials of the Ruhi Institute have clearly demonstrated
their global applicability. The House of Justice has noted in
a letter dated 26 July 2004 written on its behalf that those
national communities which have adopted the materials “have
increasingly shown the beneficial effect of this training on the
expansion of the teaching work, the rise in the level of human
resources, and the breaking down of the earlier barriers between Bahá’ís and others in worshipping together and in areas
of service, including the education of children.”14 Further, with
the spread in the use of its materials, the letter stated, “the Ruhi
Institute has continued to evolve, incorporating the experiences
and suggestions of friends in many parts of the world” into its
materials.15
In communities where the materials of the Ruhi Institute
have been adopted as the main sequence of the courses, training
institutes are beginning to supplement these courses with others
that are tailored to the specific needs of the populations they
seek to serve. These other courses are generally offered after
the completion of one or another course in the main sequence,
which, in this case, can be thought of as a trunk of a tree with
branches extending out from it. This model was of course discussed in the 9 January 2001 message of the House of Justice.
“The main sequence,” the message read, “much like the trunk
of a tree, supports courses branching out from it, each branch
dedicated to some specific area of training.”16
With the majority of national communities adopting such
a model, using the courses of the Ruhi Institute as the main
sequence, they have begun to derive unexpected benefits from
this arrangement. The letter dated 26 July quoted above went
on to say that “a fortunate side effect of the choice of one set of
materials by so many communities has been a commonality of
experience in this vitally important Bahá’í activity throughout
267

44.16

44.17

44.18

Turning Point

the world.”17 The letter was referring to a statement from the
Rid.ván 2004 message of the House of Justice:
44.19

On assessing the opportunities and needs of their respective communities, the great majority of National Spiritual
Assemblies have chosen to adopt the course materials
devised by the Ruhi Institute, finding them most responsive
to the Plan’s needs. This has had the collateral benefit
that the same materials have been translated into many
languages and, wherever Bahá’ís travel, they find other
friends following the same path and familiar with the same
books and methods.18

44.19

44.20

Adopting a sequence of courses in this way has enabled
the institutions to think more systematically about developing
the human resources of their communities. For they could now
set numerical goals “as to the number of believers who will
pass through courses at various levels during a specified time
period.”19 The metaphor of a “pyramid” of human resources
is sometimes used in this respect, as explained in the passage
below to one National Assembly:

44.20

44.21

In letters written on its behalf to other National Spiritual
Assemblies, the House of Justice has stated that the development of human resources in a country may be likened
to the building of an ever-expanding pyramid, whose base
must be constantly broadened. An increasing number of
friends are recruited to enter the first basic course, and
relatively significant percentages are then helped to reach
higher and higher courses, enhancing thereby their capacity
for service.20

44.21

44.22

It is in this context that the system for the delivery of
courses—the other principal area of learning—becomes important. In order to have “ever-growing contingents of believers”
pass through the sequence of courses, training institutes soon
came to realize that they would need to put in place a decentralized system of delivery. “The limitations of the approach in
which institute courses are offered only to groups of believers
at central facilities”21 were all too apparent:

44.22

44.23

The primary challenge before you is to help hundreds and
then thousands of the believers in Haiti to enter your institute program and study a well-defined sequence of courses.

44.23

268

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

Clearly, you cannot accomplish this by inviting them all to
one central location.22
44.24

The idea that finally emerged was the study circle because it
enabled the curriculum to reach large numbers. In this connection, the House of Justice noted that the approach that seems to
be “most effective in reaching believers at the local level is the
formation of study circles which are coordinated by a national
institute. . . . In this case, a sequence of courses is offered to
small groups of believers in a locality by tutors or teachers
trained by the institute itself.”23 A letter to an individual dated
24 May 2001 elaborated on the theme:

44.24

44.25

As you know, a study circle is not a structure in the
Bahá’í Administrative Order. Rather, it is one element of a
scheme of distance education that is showing great promise
as it becomes more firmly established in Bahá’í communities throughout the world. From the reports received at
the World Centre, it is clear that the success of this scheme
depends on the degree to which the flexibility inherent to
it is exploited. In many places a study circle will continue
with the same tutor from course to course. Yet the membership of a study circle does not have to be fixed. Often the
demands of life, especially the mobility of people today,
prevent a person from studying the full sequence of courses
with one group. Thus, after the completion of a course,
one or two friends may find that they have to suspend
their studies for a time and join another group for the
next course when their circumstances allow. It is precisely
because of this inherent flexibility that the scheme is proving to be so effective in moving a significant percentage of
believers through a sequence of courses and in developing
thereby the human resources of the community.24

44.25

44.26

Of course, some form of organizational structure is required
in order to maintain a system of distance education in which a
number of study circles are conducted throughout the year. This
organizational structure does not need to be overly elaborate.
A “national coordinator, assisted by regional coordinators
if necessary, as well as a growing number of tutors in the
country,”25 is generally sufficient, in addition, of course, to the
institute board appointed by the National Spiritual Assembly in
consultation with the Counsellors. The following excerpt from
a letter addresses the roles of the board and coordinator:

44.26

269

Turning Point
44.27

With such a focused aim, the roles of the respective
participants are also clear. The coordinator needs to operate at the level of implementation, carrying out day-to-day
plans and activities and ensuring that the basic function of
the institute is performed—this, with the assistance of the
tutors and any staff if necessary. The board oversees the
institute process as a whole, largely through the periodic
reports of the coordinator and through occasional consultations. It will want to make itself readily accessible to the
coordinator, providing the atmosphere in which he or she
can share ideas, seek the board’s views on the possibilities
and challenges facing the institute, and benefit from its advice. To carry out its role, the board does not need to meet
frequently, as does a committee charged with undertaking
a set of specific tasks.26

44.27

44.28

As mentioned in the 26 December 1995 message of the
House of Justice, the structure of the organization in place in
a community to oversee the development of human resources
will depend to some extent upon the size of the community.
National Assemblies with geographically large communities
have chosen in consultation with the Counsellors to devolve
responsibility for the implementation of courses on training
institutes at the regional level, each with its own board and a
regional coordinator. Regardless of the arrangements in place,
the institutional capacity created in most national communities
to impart spiritual education to growing numbers of believers
was significant enough by 2001 for the House of Justice to
make the following announcement:

44.28

44.29

. . . there are many countries in which the institute is the
only structure developing the capacity to organize and
maintain courses in locality after locality. As this approach
is working well with youth and adults, and increasingly for
junior youth, there is no reason why the training institute
should not also shoulder similar responsibility with respect
to children, where necessary. As a general rule, institutes
do not take on the administration of plans and programs
for expansion and consolidation. Conducting children’s
classes, however, is a unique enterprise, of special urgency.
In those countries where the task is given to it, the institute
becomes a center of learning intensely engaged in the

44.29

270

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

spiritual education of the friends from the tenderest age
through adulthood.27
44.30

44.31

44.32

The above offers a vision of a powerful educational institution offering a range of programs for children, junior youth,
youth over 15, and adults—all carried out in the context of
the expansion and consolidation of the Faith. As a means of
ensuring that its programs keep current with the demands of
growth at the level of the cluster, two additional mechanisms
have proven to be important. One is the intensive institute
campaign. Such campaigns, the House of Justice explained in
its Rid.ván 2005 message, when they pay due attention to the
practice required, “have remained the vehicle for stimulating
growth at the cluster level.”28 And when a cluster approaches
the point where it is ready to launch an intensive program of
growth, it is often necessary to have an institute coordinator
at the level of the cluster—the other mechanism. Such a coordinator is “responsible for ensuring that the number of study
circles, children’s classes, and junior youth groups steadily
multiplies.”29 He or she is “required to work with a growing
contingent of tutors and children’s class teachers in the cluster,
maintaining their enthusiasm and helping them to improve the
quality of their services.”30
The above describes in the briefest terms the nature of the
institutional capacity that has been built through successive
global Plans, beginning with the Four Year Plan, to develop the
human resources needed for the expansion and consolidation
of the Faith. As noted earlier, “the effects of this systematic
approach to human resource development are making themselves felt in the lives of all three protagonists of the Plan—the
individual believer, the institutions, and the local community.”
National Assemblies had to develop the capacity to encourage
and empower the friends in their efforts to advance the institute
process and to ensure that the institute had what it needed to
succeed at its task:

44.30

As for your National Assembly, what is needed most
from you at this time is the kind of enthusiastic and energetic support for the institute process that comes from an
ever-increasing understanding of the dynamics of growth in
Ethiopia. Through constant encouragement, the judicious
assignment of resources, and frequent consultations with
the Counsellors, you can promote the learning called for

44.32

271

44.31

Turning Point

in the Five Year Plan and ensure that the creative energies
of the many dedicated Ethiopian believers are channeled
constructively and the vast potential of your community is
realized.31
44.33

For the friends serving in the institute to be empowered in
this way, they would need a wide degree of latitude to carry
out their work:

44.33

44.34

Crucial to the future success of the institute will be
the freedom of movement and action that it enjoys. The
institute is, of course, an agency functioning under your
aegis, and ultimately matters related to its operation rest
with you. However, at this point in the growth of the Faith,
the mandate of the institute is fairly clear-cut: A sequence of
courses has been adopted as the national program for the
development of human resources. It is the job of the institute, then, to help a steadily increasing number of youth and
adults advance through that sequence and to carry out the
concomitant task of organizing and maintaining classes for
junior youth and children. There is little need for lengthy
and frequent consultations to set direction and devise and
rethink fundamental plans. Now is the time for action, and
the central participants driving the institute process should
be granted the latitude required to perform their functions
effectively. Specifically, the national coordinator should be
invested with enough authority to ensure that the basic
purpose of the institute to raise up active supporters of the
Faith is fulfilled.32

44.34

44.35

It also meant that National Assemblies would be challenged
to find new approaches to overseeing the work of its agencies:

44.35

44.36

Your institute has been structured so as to accommodate a range of dynamic programs, including one in the
area of mass media communications through the radio station. At the apex of its organizational structure is a board
of directors that sets general policies, offers guidance as
needed, and provides a forum for the executive director to
share concerns and seek advice from time to time. Surely it
is to be expected that such a complex organization would
develop certain patterns and cycles in performing its operations, including phases for planning and budgeting. To halt
the established rhythm to enable the National Spiritual

44.36

272

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

Assembly to carry out an evaluation of the institute’s
performance and give it instructions does not seem justified.
This is not to say that the desire of the National Assembly
to follow the progress of the institute is not a legitimate
one. Indeed, at any time during the year or over the course
of the Five Year Plan, you may wish to review the institute’s
work, along with the Counsellors, and provide guidance
and encouragement. But this should not prevent the institute
from proceeding with its programs, nor cause it to suffer
from the lack of financial resources. Further, when adjustments are felt necessary, they should be done in a way that
does not slacken the gathering momentum of the processes
of growth in your community. You should remember that,
in the final analysis, much of the success of your efforts to
meet the requirements of the Five Year Plan will depend on
the continued steady progress of your national agency for
the development of human resources.33
44.37

National Assemblies gradually had to come to appreciate
that although having human resources in the field provided
communities with the manpower needed to ensure that the
growth of the Faith could move forward, this should never
preclude the participation of all of the friends in its work.
However, Assemblies also had to realize that certain positions
would necessarily involve some formal preparation:

44.37

44.38

Clearly the way should be open to all the friends to
participate in the affairs of the Faith, to the extent that their
personal circumstances and their desire to serve allow. In
general, within the Bahá’í community, a distinction between
“trained” and “untrained” believers is unwarranted. There
do exist certain positions of service, however, that require
specific qualifications, and an Assembly will naturally consider these qualifications in naming individual believers to
fill them. In the case of a position responsible for coordinating courses offered according to a curriculum that has been
adopted by the institutions, it seems only reasonable that
the person called upon to perform this service would have a
considerable degree of experience with the set of courses in
question. Care should be taken, however, that such requirements are only brought into consideration when clearly
necessary, for to have requisites for ­performing every kind
of activity would have the harmful result of barring many

44.38

273

Turning Point

devoted and eager friends from contributing to the unfoldment of the Five Year Plan and, ultimately, the advancement
of the Faith.34
44.39

The institutions also had to exercise the ability to help
the friends to avoid creating false dichotomies on the basis of
misunderstandings about the global Plans and to recognize that
deepening and human resource development should not be held
in opposition to each other:

44.39

44.40

National winter and summer schools, as well as
deepening classes at the local level, are an integral aspect
of community life in which the friends come together to
deepen their knowledge of the Faith. Institutes were created
as an instrument to develop the human resources necessary
for the expansion and consolidation of the Faith. These two
elements are complementary, and benefit from each other as
they both flourish.35

44.40

44.41

For local communities, the effects of training institutes have
been significant as well. The acts of service treated in the main
sequence of the Ruhi Institute courses are intended to set in motion a process that will lead to the sound development of local
communities or, as envisioned in the Five Year Plan, of clusters.
A plan of growth for the cluster is, in some sense, embedded in
the sequence of courses, as described in the passage below:

44.41

44.42

The training institute is intended to endow a certain percentage of the friends in a community with the spiritual insights,
knowledge, and skills and abilities necessary to perform the
various tasks that accelerated expansion and consolidation
of the Faith demands. Through the deployment of such
believers in the field of service, then, needs of the kind
you have identified can gradually be met. In the sequence
of courses adopted by your institute, for instance, those
who have completed the first course often go on to initiate
devotional meetings in their localities, an act of service that
in many places constitutes the beginnings of a sustainable
pattern of community life. This pattern is strengthened as
participants in the courses gain the capacity to deepen their
fellow believers in the fundamentals of the Faith through
a program of home visits and to conduct classes for the
spiritual education of children. As such ­ efforts to deepen
the generality of the believers and educate their children

44.42

274

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

advance, the level of their participation in essential aspects
of Bahá’í community life, for example, the Nineteen Day
Feast and Holy Day observances, likewise increases.36
44.43

Communities, of course, are the collective expression of
the individuals who compose them and who strive to promote
their development. Ultimately, then, the purpose of the training
institute is to build the capacity of individuals to meet the many
needs of growing, vibrant communities. The content and order
of the courses of the Ruhi Institute are based on a series of acts
of service, the practice of which seeks to enhance such capacity.
It views this process of capacity building in terms of “walking
a path of service.” On such a path the friends are assisted first
in accomplishing relatively simple tasks and then in performing
more complex and demanding acts of service. This is the nature
of capacity building. Each is accompanied by another as he
learns to walk the path on his own. “One of the most noteworthy outcomes of the institute courses,” the Universal House of
Justice has recently noted, “is the emergence of an ever-increasing number of tutors who, having themselves studied the courses
and struggled to walk a path of service, engage others in the
study of the sequence, instilling in them the same desire to arise
and serve.”37 “Arise, then,” it has urged, “to engage more and
more trusted members of your families, friends, neighbors and
coworkers in the sequence of courses and assist them to walk
the path of service so that a sizeable expansion of the Bahá’í
community is hastened and sustained.”38

275

45
Learning to Open Aspects of
Bahá’í Community Life to Others

45.1

Referring to the development of communities at the level of
the cluster, the Universal House of Justice wrote the following
at the start of the Five Year Plan: “Among the initial goals for
every community should be the establishment of study circles,
children’s classes, and devotional meetings, open to all the
inhabitants of the locality.”1 In its Rid.ván 2002 message it
commented that significant progress had been made in opening
these activities to society at large, citing the training institute as
the means for this development:

45.1

45.2

It is most encouraging to see that the progress of this
work is being energized through the training institute
process, which was considerably strengthened last year by
the campaigns undertaken in many countries to increase
the number of trained tutors. Where a training institute
is well established and constantly functioning, three core
activities—study circles, devotional meetings, and children’s
classes—have multiplied with relative ease. Indeed, the
increasing participation of seekers in these activities, at the
invitation of their Bahá’í friends, has lent a new dimension
to their purposes, consequently effecting new enrollments.
Here, surely, is a direction of great promise for the teaching
work. These core activities, which at the outset were devised
principally to benefit the believers themselves, are naturally
becoming portals for entry by troops. By combining study
circles, devotional meetings and children’s classes within
the framework of clusters, a model of coherence in lines
of action has been put in place and is already producing
welcome results. Worldwide application of this model, we
feel confident, holds immense possibilities for the progress
of the Cause in the years ahead.2

45.2

277

Turning Point
45.3

In the passage above the House of Justice encouraged the
friends to fully exploit the possibilities for growth inherent in
the three core activities. So successful was the Bahá’í community in doing so that the House of Justice could comment in its
message of 17 January 2003 that the orientation of the Bahá’í
world to society at large had undergone a significant change:

45.3

45.4

The coherence thus achieved through the establishment of study circles, devotional meetings and children’s
classes provides the initial impulse for growth in a cluster,
an impulse that gathers strength as these core activities
multiply in number. Campaigns that help a sizeable group
of ­ believers advance far enough in the main sequence
of courses to perform the necessary acts of service lend
impetus to this multiplication of activity.
It is evident, then, that a systematic approach to training has created a way for Bahá’ís to reach out to the surrounding society, share Bahá’u’lláh’s message with friends,
family, neighbors and coworkers, and expose them to the
richness of His teachings. This outward-looking orientation
is one of the finest fruits of the grassroots learning taking
place.3

45.4

45.6

One obstacle believers had to overcome to achieve this
change in orientation was the fear of introducing family and
friends to educational programs whose content goes beyond the
presentation of Bahá’í principles to speak about teachings that
are explicitly religious in nature. A letter dated 25 September
2001 to a National Assembly encouraged the Assembly in this
regard in the context of children’s classes:

45.6

45.7

It is possible, of course, to create a program for children
which is inspired by the Bahá’í teachings and conveys such
topics as moral education, comparative religion, peace,
concern for the environment, service to humanity, or world
citizenship. Such programs might also convey practical
subjects such as literacy, academic tutoring, or vocational
training.
In its message dated 9 January 2001, however, the
House of Justice refers specifically to Bahá’í children’s
classes as also being open to non-Bahá’í children. In the
case of these classes, which are intended to address the
complete spiritual education of Bahá’ís, it would not be
possible to eliminate Bahá’í religious teachings, and topics

45.8

278

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

45.9

45.10

45.11

such as Bahá’í history, Bahá’í laws, and the Covenant
would be an integral part of these classes.
While Bahá’í religious teachings are part of the program of child education in Bahá’í classes, the design of
the program, particularly the sequencing of content, may
make it more attractive to non-Bahá’ís. For example, in
the approach taken to child education in Ruhi Institute
Book 3, the emphasis is placed initially on character
development, and only later are specific aspects related to
the life of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb introduced. So too can
we see the same principle at work in the main sequence of
books in which many non-Bahá’í youth have participated.
Book 1 addresses such broad topics as prayer and life and
death (from a Bahá’í perspective, of course). It is in Book 4
that history is presented in detail. Thus a non-Bahá’í can
feel welcome to participate and is not overwhelmed by
new, purely religious teachings. Then, if attracted by the
principles and general spiritual teachings, the non-Bahá’ís
would not hesitate to engage in the full program; alternatively, they are free to withdraw or not participate in some
segments.4
Since the beginning of the Four Year Plan, the House of
Justice has envisioned that the educational process set in motion and the activities it would engender would be open to the
community at large and serve as a means of teaching the Faith.
In this way a letter dated 8 May 1997 written on behalf of the
House of Justice encouraged the National Assembly of Bulgaria
to open some of its institute courses to those who were not
Bahá’ís, saying: “In addition to attracting thoughtful people to
the Cause, such courses could also be a means of confirming
them in the Faith and increasing the number of Bahá’u’lláh’s
faithful followers in your country.”5 Indeed, concern for the
generality of humankind and its spiritual development has been
at the heart of the call of the House of Justice to the Bahá’í
world to focus its attention on advancing the process of entry
by troops. “The community must become imbued with a sense
of mission,” the House of Justice wrote when announcing the
Four Year Plan, “and the Assembly grow in awareness of its
role as a channel of God’s grace not only for the Bahá’ís but for
the entire village, town or city in which it serves.”6
Although significant progress has been made in opening the
Bahá’í community to society at large, its orientation towards
279

45.9

45.10

45.11

Turning Point

those who have not yet declared their faith in Bahá’u’lláh will
require continued adjustment. There seems to be a natural human tendency to draw a distinction between “us” and “them.”
A letter dated 27 April 2004 to an individual warns Bahá’ís
not to allow their expectations to create unnecessary barriers
for people:
45.12

From a careful reading of the messages regarding the
Five Year Plan, it should be clear that the House of Justice
is not calling on the friends to forgo all activities except
devotional meetings, children’s classes and study circles
in their efforts to attract people to the Cause. Through a
variety of endeavors, including regular firesides, seekers
should be helped to reach the point where they eagerly
embrace the Faith and join the Bahá’í community. Yet it
is equally evident that the core activities of the Plan are
proving to be an excellent means for the friends everywhere
to widen their circle of influence and share Bahá’u’lláh’s
message with a growing number of people from different
segments of society. Further, where such an open attitude
exists among the believers, the distinction between those
who are formally enrolled in the Faith and those who are
drawing close to it does not define the level of their involvement in these core activities. Specifically, experience around
the world suggests that many seekers, though certainly not
all, welcome the opportunity to study the full sequence of
institute courses and even engage in acts of service that
contribute to Bahá’í community life, for instance hosting
devotional meetings and teaching children’s classes. Such
participation has often been instrumental in the eventual
confirmation of their faith and in their formal declaration.
Care should be taken, therefore, that we do not allow our
own expectations to set limits on people which, in reality,
may not exist.7

45.12

45.13

Rather than simply categorizing people as “non-Bahá’ís,”
believers are encouraged, then, to see “each person who is
drawn to explore Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings” somewhere along a
“never-ending continuum of spiritual search.”8 A letter dated
4 May 2005 written on behalf of the House of Justice to the
National Assembly of Kazakhstan shows the extent to which
this way of thinking should influence how we approach the
question of teaching:

45.13

280

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts
45.14

Most heartening to note are the plans to form six teams,
some composed of family members, who will reach out to
their friends, neighbors and relatives. The teams will work
systematically to help an increasing number of seekers advance through the sequence of institute courses, nurturing in
them the desire to begin core activities with their own family
and friends. The intimate friendship that develops between
team members and course participants will foster the resolve
and capacity of the latter to reach out to other souls and
assist them to arise, in turn, to carry out acts of service. In
this way, a handful of believers can significantly extend the
spiritual influence of the institute and lay a strong foundation for the accelerated expansion of the community.9

45.14

45.15

Central to this way of thinking seems to be the attitude
Bahá’ís adopt towards the teachings of the Faith. The House
of Justice has said that “Bahá’ís should give the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh liberally and unconditionally to humanity so that
people may apply them to pressing social issues and uplift
themselves materially and spiritually.”10 It was this posture of
giving to which the Guardian referred when he said,

45.15

45.16

We must be like the fountain or spring that is continually emptying itself of all that it has and is continually being
refilled from an invisible source. To be continually giving
out for the good of our fellows undeterred by fear of poverty and reliant on the unfailing bounty of the Source of all
wealth and all good—this is the secret of right living.11

45.16

45.17

A posture of giving, it seems, is an essential attribute of
the intensive programs of growth that will continue to be the
object of learning during the years to come. At the heart of
these programs is the realization that the Faith is not intended
for Bahá’ís alone but rather for all of humanity:

45.17

45.18

The friends who participate in these intensive programs
of growth should bear in mind that the purpose is to ensure
that the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh reaches the masses
of humanity and enables them to achieve spiritual and
material progress through the application of the Teachings.
Vast numbers among the peoples of the world are ready,
indeed yearn, for the bounties that Bahá’u’lláh alone can
bestow upon them once they have committed themselves
to building the new society He has envisioned. In ­learning

45.18

281

Turning Point

to systematize their large-scale teaching work, Bahá’í
­communities are becoming better equipped to respond
to this longing. They cannot withhold whatever effort,
whatever sacrifice, may be called for.12

282

46
Learning to Reach
Receptive Populations

46.1

In its message dated 17 January 2003, the Universal House
of Justice noted the effectiveness of the pattern of growth
established through the multiplication of core activities among
Bahá’ís and their families and friends. It then went on to
remark that

46.1

46.2

In many parts of the world, bringing large numbers
into the ranks of Bahá’u’lláh’s followers has traditionally
not been a formidable task. It is therefore encouraging to
see that, in some of the more developed clusters, carefully
designed projects are being added to the existing pattern
of growth to reach receptive populations and lift the rate
of expansion to a higher level. Such projects accelerate the
tempo of teaching, already on the rise through the efforts
of individuals.1

46.2

46.3

In this connection, it was explained to one National Spiritual
Assembly that “in general, focusing on receptive populations
is one of the strategies of the Five Year Plan for accelerating
growth.”2 On a number of occasions the House of Justice has
underscored the importance of focusing efforts on receptive
populations and systematically sharing Bahá’u’lláh’s message
with them through appropriate methods and approaches. The
framework of the Five Year Plan, however, offered National
Assemblies a new way of addressing the question. In a letter
dated 20 March 2002, the National Assembly of Austria was
advised to select a cluster with a receptive minority population
for special attention:

46.3

46.4

An important challenge now before you is to ensure
that one or two clusters in Austria reach the level at which
intensive growth programs can be established. This will
involve, foremost, helping the institute in your country

46.4

283

Turning Point

develop to a more advanced stage, endowed with the capacity to accompany a significant percentage of individuals
up to the point in its sequence of courses where they can
be trained to act as tutors and multiply the number of
study circles in the clusters selected. Given the receptivity
displayed in the past by some of the minority groups in
Austria, for example the Turkish, you would clearly do well
to choose at least one cluster with a large representation of
such a population.3
46.5

Every cluster, of course, has different demographic cross
sections and will often have distinct social and ethnic groups.
It is envisioned that, once the institute process in a cluster is
well founded, activities will “move to the stage of reaching
special populations.”4 The House of Justice, for instance, in a
letter dated 5 August 2004 written on its behalf to the National
Assembly of Canada, expressed the hope that the intensive
program of growth launched in Vancouver would take advantage of the receptivity displayed among the Chinese-speaking
population:

46.5

46.6

Your Assembly has no doubt already begun to give
thought to how best to capitalize on the success. The House
of Justice hopes that this development can be energetically
exploited in pursuit of the teaching objectives of the Five
Year Plan. Where clusters have advanced to such a degree
that they are ready to take up the challenge of intensive
growth, nothing is more promising than to encounter a
significant opening among a minority population like the
Chinese-speaking Canadians. Seizing such opportunities
requires a major shift from the gradualist approach that
meets the needs of clusters at earlier stages of progress.
The House of Justice is confident that, with your
encouragement, the Regional Council will be able to devise
an intensive program of activities focusing on the specific
needs of Vancouver’s Chinese population. Apart from taking advantage of Ms. . . .’s very welcome willingness to lend
assistance, it may also be wise for the Council to contact the
Bahá’í Committee for China with respect to other human
resources, teaching materials and practical suggestions.5

46.6

As the above passage suggests, the success of efforts to
bring receptive populations into the Faith depends, to some
degree, on the ability of teachers who can present the message

46.8

46.7

46.8

284

46.7

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

in a suitable manner. The role of the institute, then, is crucial
in this respect. “A major object of the recent emphasis on establishing training institutes,” the House of Justice has advised,
“is to increase the capacity of individuals to teach the Cause
effectively.”6 An excerpt from the 9 January 2001 message of
the House of Justice further explains the relationship between
training and teaching:
46.9

With the work of institutes growing in strength, attention has now to be given everywhere to systematizing
teaching efforts. In the document “The Institution of
the Counsellors” just issued, we emphasize the role that
the Auxiliary Board members and their assistants play
in helping the friends to meet this challenge, both at the
level of individual initiative and of collective volition. As
individuals progress through institute courses, they deepen
their knowledge of the Faith, gain insights, and acquire
skills of service. Some of the courses devoted to teaching
will no doubt treat the subject in general terms. Others will
focus on various means of sharing Bahá’u’lláh’s message
with specific segments of society, incorporating the wisdom
gleaned from the teaching endeavors of the friends. This
combined process of action, learning and training will
endow communities with an ever-increasing number of
capable and eager teachers of the Cause.7

46.9

46.10

This passage indicates that, as experience is gained in
reaching out to a population, the learning that is acquired can
then be systematized in courses that are offered by the training institute. As more and more individuals take part in the
courses and gain the knowledge, spiritual insights and skills
needed to bring people from among the population into the
Cause, teaching activities multiply, enrollments increase, and
further learning occurs which can be incorporated into the
courses. “Training and teaching, then, become two parallel
processes that fuel each other,”8 explained the 1998 document
“Training Institutes.” “Training courses raise the enthusiasm
of the friends for teaching and help them acquire the necessary
skills. Increased experience in the teaching field is reflected in
the constantly improving content of training courses.”9
Such courses, then, can be regarded as the chronicles of
the evolving experience of the Bahá’í community in sharing
Bahá’u’lláh’s message. They report what the community is

46.10

46.11

285

46.11

Turning Point

doing and learning. They systematize both the knowledge
­being generated through collective action and the results of that
systematization. As endeavors to reach different populations
and social groups intensify through programs of growth in
the coming years, it is imagined that significant effort will be
dedicated to developing branch courses in this way. A letter
dated 26 June 2002 written on behalf of the House of Justice
underscores the need for such courses:
46.12

The 9 January 2001 message of the Universal House of
Justice likened an institute’s main sequence of courses to
the trunk of a tree, from which branch out other courses.
One can already observe a degree of diversity emerging as
branch courses begin to appear in some programs, designed
to meet specific training needs. The elaboration of such
courses will necessarily proceed in a gradual fashion since
effective course content will depend on the amount of learning and experience acquired in the field of action.10

46.12

46.13

Training, however, will not be sufficient to raise the tempo
of teaching, as explained in the 9 January message:

46.13

46.14

Training alone, of course, does not necessarily lead to
an upsurge in teaching activity. In every avenue of service,
the friends need sustained encouragement. Our expectation
is that the Auxiliary Board members, together with their
assistants, will give special thought to how individual initiative can be cultivated, particularly as it relates to teaching.
When training and encouragement are effective, a culture
of growth is nourished in which the believers see their
duty to teach as a natural consequence of having accepted
Bahá’u’lláh. They “raise high the sacred torch of faith,” as
was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wish, “labor ceaselessly, by day and by
night,” and “consecrate every fleeting moment of their lives
to the diffusion of the divine fragrance and the exaltation
of God’s holy Word.” So enkindled do their hearts become
with the fire of the love of God that whoever approaches
them feels its warmth. They strive to be channels of the
spirit, pure of heart, selfless and humble, possessing certitude and the courage that stems from reliance on God. In
such a culture, teaching is the dominating passion of the
lives of the believers. Fear of failure finds no place. Mutual
support, commitment to learning, and appreciation of
diversity of action are the prevailing norms.11

46.14

286

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts
46.15

Clearly, much work remains to be done in this regard.
While a number of populations have been identified for special
attention in recent years, the Bahá’í community is still at the
initial stages of systematizing the knowledge it is acquiring in
teaching the Faith among them. These populations include “the
Sami and the other peoples of the arctic and sub-arctic areas
as far north as Spitsbergen,” mentioned in the Rid.ván 1996
message to the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in Europe, as well as the
inhabitants of “the islands of the Mediterranean, the Atlantic
and the North Sea” and “the Romany peoples, who have begun
to show such receptivity to the call of Bahá’u’lláh.”12 Arabic
speakers in North America have been urged to focus on “attracting souls from amongst the Arab population” within their
clusters,13 and the National Assembly of the United States has
been advised that, among the Muslim population, Kurds and
Afghans may be particularly receptive.14 In 2002 the National
Assembly of Uganda was asked to assist in spreading “the
spirit of the teachings among seeking and receptive souls” in
Sudanese refugee camps in the northern part of the country.15
And Bahá’í youth have been encouraged to “seek out receptive
souls” in “schools, at . . . universities, and in the workplace.”16
Along these lines, the Rid.ván 1996 message to the followers of
Bahá’u’lláh in Latin America and the Caribbean drew attention
to the fact that

46.15

46.16

. . . the climate of search prevailing among both the leaders and the masses in your countries, which has emerged
following the ideological upheaval of recent years, is of
special significance. Two sectors have been particularly
and differently affected and are athirst for the life-giving
waters of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation: on the one hand, the
teachers in the national school systems and, on the other,
university students and their professors. Historically, both
have exerted widespread influence in your societies, and
should you teach them systematically, you will certainly
reap abundant fruits.17

46.16

46.17

These are only a few of the populations that, it is imagined, will be the focus of the serious attention of the Bahá’í
community in the years to come as it pursues the aim of
advancing the process of entry by troops and strives to bring
together “the diverse members of the human race in ever closer
association.”18

Learning to Exercise Disciplined Initiative
and to Participate in Collective Action

47.1

47.2

47.3

“The power to act,” the Universal House of Justice has stated,
“resides primarily in the entire body of the believers. This
power is unlocked at the level of individual initiative and at
the level of collective volition.”1 “If the Cause is to realize
Bahá’u’lláh’s purpose for humankind,” attention must be given
to “the release of power in both these expressions.”2 In this
light, the House of Justice has explained that “it is the duty
and privilege of the individual” to take initiative “in teaching
the Cause and in obtaining a deeper understanding of the
purpose and requirements of the Faith.”3 “Parallel with the
exercise of such initiative,” it has indicated, “is the necessity of
the individual’s participation in collective endeavors, such as
community functions and projects.”4
At the start of the Four Year Plan, the Rid.ván 1996 message
described the role of the individual in the work of the Faith in
these terms:
The role of the individual is of unique importance in
the work of the Cause. It is the individual who manifests
the vitality of faith upon which the success of the teaching
work and the development of the community depend.
Bahá’u’lláh’s command to each believer to teach His Faith
confers an inescapable responsibility which cannot be
transferred to, or assumed by, any institution of the Cause.
The individual alone can exercise those capacities which
include the ability to take initiative, to seize opportunities,
to form friendships, to interact personally with others, to
build relationships, to win the cooperation of others in
common service to the Faith and society, and to convert
into action the decisions made by consultative bodies. It is
the individual’s duty to “consider every avenue of approach
289

47.1

47.2

47.3

Turning Point

47.4

47.5

which he might utilize in his personal attempts to capture
the attention, maintain the interest, and deepen the faith, of
those whom he seeks to bring into the fold of his Faith.”
To optimize the use of these capacities, the individual
draws upon his love for Bahá’u’lláh, the power of the
Covenant, the dynamics of prayer, the inspiration and education derived from regular reading and study of the Holy
Texts, and the transformative forces that operate upon his
soul as he strives to behave in accordance with the divine
laws and principles. In addition to these, the individual,
having been given the duty to teach the Cause, is endowed
with the capacity to attract particular blessings promised
by Bahá’u’lláh. “Whoso openeth his lips in this Day,” the
Blessed Beauty asserts, “and maketh mention of the name
of his Lord, the hosts of Divine inspiration shall descend
upon him from the heaven of My name, the All-Knowing,
the All-Wise. On him shall also descend the Concourse on
high, each bearing aloft a chalice of pure light.”
Shoghi Effendi underscored the absolute necessity of
individual initiative and action. He explained that without
the support of the individual, “at once wholehearted,
continuous and generous,” every measure and plan of his
National Spiritual Assembly is “foredoomed to failure,”
the purpose of the Master’s Divine Plan is “impeded”;
furthermore, the sustaining strength of Bahá’u’lláh Himself
“will be withheld from every and each individual who
fails in the long run to arise and play his part.” Hence, at
the very crux of any progress to be made is the individual
believer, who possesses the power of execution which only
he can release through his own initiative and sustained
action. Regarding the sense of inadequacy that sometimes
hampers individual initiative, a letter written on his behalf
conveys the Guardian’s advice: “Chief among these, you
mention the lack of courage and of initiative on the part
of the believers, and a feeling of inferiority which prevents
them from addressing the public. It is precisely these weaknesses that he wishes the friends to overcome, for these do
not only paralyze their efforts but actually serve to quench
the flame of faith in their hearts. Not until all the friends
come to realize that every one of them is able, in his own
measure, to deliver the Message, can they ever hope to
reach the goal that has been set before them by a loving
290

47.4

47.5

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

and wise Master. . . . Everyone is a potential teacher. He has
only to use what God has given him and thus prove that he
is faithful to his trust.”5
47.6

Two years into the Plan, at Rid.ván 1998, the House of
Justice made an assessment of the progress achieved. At that
time the majority of communities were still developing the
institutional capacity needed to raise up human resources called
for at the beginning of the Plan. It was in this context that the
Rid.ván message emphasized the need for training and preparing
the believers to meet the challenges before them:

47.6

47.7

Towards ensuring an orderly evolution of the community, a function of Bahá’í institutions is to organize
and maintain a process of developing human resources
whereby Bahá’ís, new and veteran alike, can acquire the
knowledge and capacity to sustain a continuous expansion
and consolidation of the community. The establishment of
training institutes is critical to such effort, since they are
centers through which large numbers of individuals can
acquire and improve their ability to teach and administer
the Faith. Their existence underscores the importance of
knowledge of the Faith as a source of power for invigorating the life of the Bahá’í community and of the individuals
who compose it.6

47.7

47.8

In this way, participation in the courses of the institute
would help the friends over the next few years to develop the
capabilities they would need to respond to the requirements
of the Plan. Equally important to the process of empowering
the individual believer, the House of Justice explained in “The
Institution of the Counsellors,” would be the Auxiliary Board
member:

47.8

47.9

Stimulating individual initiative is one of the paramount
duties of the Auxiliary Board members, a duty they can perform with the help of assistants they must carefully select,
train and nurture. It involves constant encouragement of
the friends, evoking the valor of the heroes of the Faith and
bringing to their attention the importance of exemplifying
in their lives the glory of the Teachings. It calls for fervent
and moving appeals to the believers to be the cause of unity
and harmony at all times, to attract receptive souls to the
Cause, to teach them, nourish their faith and lead them to

47.9

291

Turning Point

47.10

the shores of certitude. It requires building confidence and
changing fear and hesitation into courage and perseverance.
It asks of the Board members and those they serve alike to
forget their own weaknesses and fix their reliance on the
power of divine confirmations. Further, it implies accompanying the friends in their endeavors as they develop the
capabilities of effective service.
The role of the training institute in the development
of these capabilities can hardly be overemphasized. The
Auxiliary Board members are to use this powerful instrument to change passive acceptance of the Faith into a
passion for teaching. As they generate enthusiasm, they
need to help guide it into channels of systematic endeavor.
It is in this context of systematic action that fostering
sound individual initiative and promoting united collective
action become two complementary aims ever engaging the
Auxiliary Board member.7

47.10

47.11

With the launch of the Five Year Plan at Rid.ván 2001, and
the call to establish devotional meetings, children’s classes and
study circles in cluster after cluster, this process of spiritual
empowerment began to reach fruition and the level of participation of the individual believer in the work of the Cause
increased markedly. A letter dated 22 August 2002 written on
behalf of the House of Justice noted,

47.11

47.12

The culture now emerging is one in which groups of
Bahá’u’lláh’s followers explore together the truths in His
Teachings, freely open their study circles, devotional gatherings and children’s classes to their friends and neighbors,
and invest their efforts confidently in plans of action
designed at the level of the cluster, that makes growth a
manageable goal.8

47.12

47.13

In its 17 January 2003 message, the Universal House of
Justice attributed “the rise in activity around the world” to
the success of the institute courses “in evoking the spirit of
enterprise required to carry out the divers actions that growth
in a cluster, at whatever stage, demands.”9 “Particularly heartwarming to observe,” it wrote, “is a growing sense of initiative
and resourcefulness throughout the Bahá’í world, along with
courage and audacity. Consecration, zeal, confidence and tenacity—these are among the qualities that are distinguishing the
believers in every continent.”10 There was little doubt that the

47.13

292

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

pattern of growth emerging in the Bahá’í world was the result
of individual initiative. One letter commented that
47.14

With the emphasis in the Five Year Plan on the multiplication of devotional meetings, children’s and junior youth
classes, and study circles, the believers all over the world
have learned to open their homes, or to use other suitable
places in their localities, for holding these events.11

47.14

47.15

In some places, the effects on the life of the community have
been extraordinary. “The multiplication of the core activities
in the Five Year Plan,” another letter indicated, “has created
a vibrant Bahá’í community life. In some clusters, a host of
individual initiatives have filled every night of the calendar with
one or more events.”12
What is important to note is that the individual initiative
that has been exercised by the friends everywhere adheres to
certain requirements. It is not the kind of unrestricted individualism that, if left free to reign in a community, results in
alienation and, eventually, stagnation:

47.15

47.16

47.16

47.17

From its early days, the Bahá’í community in . . . has
been blessed by having devoted, competent and energetic
members, among both native believers and pioneers from
abroad. Its potential was, and remains, very great. Alas, the
sound development of the community has been repeatedly
hampered by the upsurge of disunity, arising largely from
the strong-mindedness of individual believers who had
conflicting opinions of what was best for the community at
any one time. Thus, a characteristic that can be a source of
strength for the Faith in . . . has become, too easily, a source
of division and thus of hindrance to the advancement of
the Cause.13

47.17

47.18

Nor does the individual initiative that has characterized the Five Year Plan have anything to do with a sense of
superiority:

47.18

47.19

In our Faith, as you know, individuals are allowed a reasonable latitude for initiative in this area [i.e., teaching] and
are free to offer the Message to others in the manner best
suited to their circumstances and opportunities. However,
difficulties arise when individual views of a method or
approach are seen to be the key for others to use in their

47.19

293

Turning Point

endeavors—a perception which all too frequently leads to
debates that are endless, usually inducing inaction.14
47.20

It is an individual initiative that recognizes that “mistakes
will be made” and is willing “to learn from these mistakes.”15
For it understands the intimate connection between doing and
being:

47.20

47.21

As you know, taking to an extreme the exhortation that
a teacher should, before all else, teach his own self can lead
to a decline in the level of teaching activity, as more and
more attention becomes focused on one’s own perfection.
There are, of course, numerous passages in the Writings
which ask us to make daily effort so that our inner lives
increasingly reflect the Teachings of the Faith. Moreover,
it is evident that our inner state has a direct bearing on
the success of our teaching efforts. But the Writings also
tell us not to look at our own shortcomings, but to rely on
the power of divine assistance in delivering His Message.
The question of the development of one’s inner life and
its relation to teaching has to be viewed in this broader
context. In doing so, we should remember that all Bahá’ís
are called upon to teach the Cause, whatever their spiritual
attainments may be. Furthermore, the act of sharing the
Word of God with others profoundly affects the refinement
of one’s inner life.16

47.21

47.22

This individual initiative arises, not out of a reluctant sense
of obligation, but from deep within one’s being as a response
to the Divine call:

47.22

47.23

In all of this great endeavor . . . you must be driven by a
passion to teach the Faith. Let regular study of the Writings
feed the flame of your enthusiasm. Let His Words so shape
your thoughts that the most pressing obligation of your
lives becomes the sharing of His Message with others.17

47.23

47.24

It is an individual initiative that is born out of the conviction that faith is conscious knowledge expressed in action:

47.24

47.25

Arise, then, to engage more and more trusted members
of your families, friends, neighbors and coworkers in the
sequence of courses and assist them to walk the path of service so that a sizeable expansion of the Bahá’í community is
hastened and sustained. The time for action is now. . . .

47.25

294

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts
47.26

Ultimately, success is assured by the faith in Bahá’u’lláh
that animates every conscientious believer. Faith is a state
of conscience imbued with a compulsion to express itself
in word and deed. Teaching combines these two aspects.
Your assistance and encouragement as tutors can foster in
the participants of study circles the spirit of initiative to
follow your example so that a stream of receptive souls may
find their home and haven in the Cause. Do your utmost to
carry out this noble and meritorious service with dispatch,
losing no opportunity. Surely, the forces of the Concourse
on high are ever ready to confirm your endeavors.18

47.26

47.27

This individual initiative does not find satisfaction in
pursuing whatever the heart desires. Nor is it characterized
by random motion according to some romantic notion about
creativity. It is an individual initiative that is sparked by a vision
of possibilities and moves in the direction of oneness. “Through
its messages on the global Plans,” as one letter has explained,
“the Universal House of Justice provides a vision to the Bahá’í
world of the opportunities and possibilities open to the Faith.
The provisions of these Plans do not remain the same from one
to the next. They build on one another in order to move the
community forward to ever great accomplishments.”19 In the
case of the Five Year Plan, the exercise of dividing countries
into clusters and categorizing them according to stages of development helped the friends to proceed with unity of thought,
for it “served to galvanize the believers,” who “were able to
evaluate in realistic terms their strengths and weaknesses and
to see with striking clarity a way forward.”20
Perhaps above all else, then, it is an individual initiative
that appreciates the value of operating within a framework,
a framework that is derived from the messages of the House
of Justice outlining the global Plans. In this connection, it
understands that discipline is not something that is imposed
from without but rather comes from an inner conviction. This
inner conviction is not simply the result of willpower, however.
For the soul manifests its powers as it learns to submit to higher
authority, ultimately the laws that govern material and spiritual
existence. An understanding of these laws influences the conscience of the individual and gives meaning to the authority
conferred upon, and the course set by, the institutions. The
House of Justice has remarked in this regard that “even though
individuals may strive to be guided in their actions by their

47.27

47.28

295

47.28

Turning Point

47.29

personal understanding of the Divine Texts, and much can be
accomplished thereby, such actions, untempered by the overall
direction provided by authorized institutions, are incapable of
attaining the thrust necessary for the unencumbered advancement of civilization.”21
To date, the combined effect of the efforts of individuals
within the framework provided by the House of Justice has
been considerable. Efforts to engage in collective action, however, have yet to reach their full potential. It is only in the latter
part of the Five Year Plan, as intensive programs of growth
have become more widespread, that significant experience has
been gained in participating in collective endeavors. Describing
such programs of growth, the 9 January 2001 message of the
House of Justice had indicated that “a range of teaching efforts” would need to be carried out “involving both activities
undertaken by the individual and campaigns promoted by the
institutions.”22 A recent letter dated 18 August 2005 to the
National Assembly of Germany underscores this point:

47.29

47.30

Like their fellow believers in many clusters around the
world, the friends in Frankfurt have labored systematically
throughout the Five Year Plan to establish the conditions
necessary for launching an intensive program of growth.
Central to their efforts has been the goal of bringing more
and more coworkers into the institute process so that a
sufficient number would be prepared to perform the acts of
service needed to sustain the accelerated expansion of the
Faith. Now that the friends have crossed that threshold and
stand ready to embark on an intensive program, they will
be challenged to set in motion a pattern of activity which
integrates individual initiative and community endeavor in
order to embrace an ever-wider circle of people and teach
receptive souls.23

47.30

47.31

No doubt it will take time for communities to learn the dynamics of such a pattern of activity. As this learning proceeds,
the friends will see the confusion and the clash of opinions
that can occasionally attend their efforts to promote intensive
programs of growth recede and a new power come into focus:

47.31

Your sincere concerns regarding the unfoldment of
the processes of the Five Year Plan in . . . are noted with
appreciation. You are encouraged to have patience, recognizing that the friends have made a very rapid advance

47.32

296

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

in their understanding and action in the past few years in
that country. This has enabled them to launch intensive
programs of growth in as many as seventeen clusters, more
than ten percent of the total number in the entire country. It
is not surprising, given such a dramatic transformation that
encompasses the efforts of so many well-intentioned believers, that some additional time must pass and additional
experience be gained before a further unity of thought and
action in matters associated with the various aspects of
administration, teaching, or the functioning of the institute
becomes apparent. Confusion and the clash of opinion will
gradually give way to a culture of learning in which the
institutions serving the friends will be able to support the
initiatives of individuals and merge diverse efforts into a
powerful collective thrust.24
47.33

The attributes the friends have acquired throughout the Five
Year Plan will surely assist them in meeting this new challenge.
It is of course imperative that they do so, for while the present
pattern of growth through the multiplication of core activities
is sufficient to welcome individuals into the Faith and integrate
them into community life, it is only through collective action
that expansion and consolidation will occur on a large scale.
And as the friends succeed in further acquiring the knowledge,
qualities, skills and abilities needed to participate effectively
in collective action, their communities will move closer to the
vision presented by the House of Justice at the start of the Four
Year Plan. In its 26 December 1995 message, it explained that

47.33

47.34

. . . those who enter the Faith must be integrated into
vibrant local communities, characterized by tolerance and
love and guided by a strong sense of purpose and collective
will, environments in which the capacities of all components
—men, women, youth and children—are developed and
their powers multiplied in unified action.25

47.34

47.35

Though clearly a concern of the individual, the challenge
of learning to exercise disciplined initiative and participate in
collective action appears to be central to the question of community development. For, as suggested by the above quotation,
the challenge is in reality to achieve universal participation in
the work of the Cause. It seems to speak to the very nature of
social organization envisioned by Bahá’u’lláh and to the welfare
of society as a whole:

47.35

297

Turning Point
47.36

“Regard the world as the human body,” wrote
Bahá’u’lláh to Queen Victoria. We can surely regard the
Bahá’í world, the army of God, in the same way. In the
human body, every cell, every organ, every nerve has its
part to play. When all do so the body is healthy, vigorous, radiant, ready for every call made upon it. No cell,
however humble, lives apart from the body, whether in
serving it or receiving from it. This is true of the body of
mankind in which God “has endowed each and all with
talents and faculties,” and is supremely true of the body
of the Bahá’í world community, for this body is already an
organism, united in its aspirations, unified in its methods,
seeking assistance and confirmation from the same Source,
and illumined with the conscious knowledge of its unity.
Therefore, in this organic, divinely guided, blessed and
illumined body the participation of every believer is of the
utmost importance, and is a source of power and vitality as
yet unknown to us.26

Learning to Administer Growth

48.1

The message below addressed by the Universal House of Justice
to the National Spiritual Assembly of India in May 2004 high­
lights a fundamental challenge that the growth of the Faith
brought to the institutions everywhere:

48.1

48.2

That a steadily growing number of the rank and file of the
Indian Bahá’í community would, cognizant of their duties
to the Cause, assume their rightful place in the forefront of
Bahá’í activity was one of our most ardent aspirations at
the outset of the Four Year Plan, and it has been a source
of immeasurable joy to us to witness the progress that has
been made towards the fulfillment of this cherished goal,
especially over the last year. The processes that you set in
motion, which have been vigorously pursued during the
current Plan, are beginning to bear their long-awaited fruits.
The challenge now falls on the institutions of the Faith to
learn to administer the affairs of a community of active
supporters of the Cause, and we have every confidence that,
through the sustaining grace of Bahá’u’lláh, this important
requirement will be met.1

48.2

48.3

As the two movements gathered momentum at the cluster
level during the Five Year Plan, it became clear that some kind
of scheme of coordination would need to be put in place to ensure continued progress. In its Rid.ván 2004 message, the House
of Justice acknowledged the relationship between the growth
of the Faith at the cluster level and the need for administrative
structures:

48.3

48.4

The movement of clusters from each level of activity to a
higher one is well in hand and, as it proceeds, the kernel of
avowed believers is being joined by a larger circle of people,
still not Bahá’ís but enthusiastically involved in core activities

48.4

299

Turning Point

of the Plan. Structures for administering intensive growth are
already appearing in certain advanced clusters.2
48.5

Such structures, then, began to emerge as a response to the
demands of growth itself and became the object of learning in
clusters where the two essential movements were well under
way. The following letter dated 26 November 2003 written
on behalf of the House of Justice to the National Assembly of
India commended its efforts to find a suitable mechanism at the
cluster level to coordinate the multiplication and deployment
of human resources:

48.5

48.6

The House of Justice is greatly pleased to know that
your Assembly is giving the question of growth at the level
of the cluster such serious consideration. That you are, on
the one hand, concerned to ensure that the institute process
continues to gather momentum in each cluster and, on the
other, eager to see the human resources thus generated
systematically deployed in the field of service is a sign of
the clarity with which you see the essential relationship
between the various elements that sustain growth. The
House of Justice will be interested to know how the efforts to establish appropriate structures at the cluster level
progress and how the learning in the area advances.3

48.6

48.7

A letter written on behalf of the House of Justice to the
National Assembly of Mexico goes further and describes the
two principal elements of an effective scheme of coordination:

48.7

48.8

Meeting the challenge of fostering such growth will
depend on the establishment and effective functioning of
certain administrative mechanisms at the level of the cluster.
It will require, on the one hand, an individual believer
named by the institute in each priority cluster who would
act as a coordinator, responsible for ensuring that the
number of study circles, children’s classes, and junior youth
groups steadily multiplies. On the other hand, it will call
for the formation of some kind of cluster-level committee
with a capable secretary in charge of promoting the gradual
increase in devotional meetings, arranging for systematic
visits to the homes of newly enrolled believers, holding
periodic reflection meetings, collecting vital statistics and
encouraging the development of the Nineteen Day Feast
and the strengthening of the Local Spiritual Assembly in

48.8

300

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

each locality, with the help of the Auxiliary Board members
and their assistants.4
48.9

A letter dated 16 September 2003 to the National Spiritual
Assembly of the Philippines elaborates the scheme in more
detail:

48.9

48.10

From all reports received at the World Center, it is
clear that there are now a few clusters in the Philippines
primed for accelerated growth. However, for such growth
to occur, administrative structures will need to be put into
place at the level of the cluster to support the processes
of expansion and consolidation. The Universal House of
Justice is happy to know that consultations are giving rise
to a scheme that identifies clearly the roles of the institute
and Regional Councils. According to this scheme, the
Dawnbreakers Foundation [the national agency responsible
for human resource development] will, we understand,
name a coordinator for each of the clusters selected who
will be responsible for ensuring that the number of study
circles for adults and older youth, Bahá’í children’s classes
and junior youth groups systematically multiplies. Such a
coordinator would be required to work with a growing
contingent of tutors and children’s class teachers in the
cluster, maintaining their enthusiasm and helping them to
improve the quality of their services.
As this educational process gains in strength, there
will be a corresponding increase in the number of those
eager to render service to the Cause, to share their newly
acquired knowledge, and to put into practice what they
have been studying. In order to facilitate the efforts of such
friends and channel their energies into effective collective
action, a strong committee with a highly capable secretary
will, it is assumed, be named by the Regional Council
to operate at the cluster level. This committee would be
assigned tasks such as promoting the spread of short-term
teaching projects and devotional meetings in the cluster,
in addition to overseeing a program of visits to the homes
of newly enrolled believers and those less active in the
community in order to deepen them in the fundamentals
of the Faith. The establishment of the Nineteen Day Feast
and the strengthening of the Local Spiritual Assemblies in
the localities would also constitute one of the committee’s

48.10

48.11

301

48.11

Turning Point

48.12

primary concerns, as would the collection of statistical
information. The latter will be vital to the efforts to monitor the growth process not only at the cluster level, but also
at the regional and national levels, and in this connection,
the House of Justice welcomes the news that your member
Mrs. . . . has been asked to assume the responsibility for
encouraging the implementation of the Statistical Report
Program throughout the country.
It is to be expected that much of the committee’s work
could be carried out by its secretary, but it would also be
possible for a few designated believers to discharge certain
administrative functions. While maintaining clearly defined
spheres of service, the institute coordinator and committee
would collaborate closely to ensure that activities are synchronized effectively. For instance, an intensive campaign to
raise the number of those who have completed the second
course in the institute’s main sequence, which prepares
them to share deepening themes, might well be followed
by an equally intensive campaign of home visits. Similarly,
although the committee would be charged with the task of
arranging periodic meetings of consultations to reflect on
progress in the cluster, the timing and the program of such
events would be fully discussed with the institute coordinator. In the performance of all their functions, the committee
and the institute coordinator would, of course, receive the
unflagging support of the Auxiliary Board members and
their assistants.5

48.12

48.13

Of course, at the outset of the Five Year Plan, the House
of Justice explained that the implementation of intensive
programs of growth would “require the close collaboration of
the institute, the Auxiliary Board members and their assistants,
and an Area Teaching Committee.”6 It was not until a sufficient
number of clusters around the world began to reach the stage
where they were ready to launch such programs, however, that
the implications of this statement came to be realized. Some of
these implications have been described by the House of Justice
in “The Institution of the Counsellors”:

48.13

48.14

The involvement of the Auxiliary Board members in
this process of design and implementation is multifaceted.
They contribute to deliberations in which the worldwide
aims and accomplishments of the Faith are analyzed, the

48.14

302

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

condition of society and the forces operating within it are
examined, opportunities and needs are detected. They bring
their knowledge of the Faith to bear on consultations that
generate shared vision and strategies for growth. Their
familiarity with the friends and their talents, particularly as
these are developed through the efforts of the training institute, enables them to draw attention to the characteristics
of plans of action that are realistic and within the grasp of
the believers. The network of assistants they each can name
provides them with the means for stimulating activity at
the local level and following it to completion. And above
all, the love and respect in which they are held create for
them the opportunity to act as standard-bearers and lead
the community in action.7
48.15

The House of Justice has further explained that “this challenging conception”8 of the work of the Auxiliary Board members
with local communities calls for

48.15

48.16

. . . a fundamental departure from limited assumptions
about social order which, in the world today, determine
administrative theory and practice. For it aspires to infuse
every act, individual and collective, with spiritual meaning.
It places the sacred at the heart of community life, making
it the focus of all reflection on activity.9

48.16

48.17

Undoubtedly a great deal of learning about administering
the affairs of communities made up of active supporters of the
Cause will continue in the months and years ahead as expansion accelerates. Already, however, some of the challenges are
beginning to emerge. The aforementioned letter to the National
Assembly of the Philippines pointed to an important one:

48.17

48.18

As you can well imagine, if the gathering momentum in
your community is to accelerate significantly, some of the
friends will have to be called upon to dedicate a period of
full-time service to the Faith at the level of the cluster. But a
word of caution is in order. A system of the magnitude being considered will not come into existence and flourish if it
depends primarily on the efforts of a cadre of remunerated
workers. Such a system must receive its impetus from the
spiritual energies of those steadfast and devoted souls who
long to labor without expectation of financial reward in the
path of God and experience the joy of contributing purely

48.18

303

Turning Point

48.19

as volunteers to plans to build His Kingdom on earth,
whether by acting as tutors, holding devotional meetings
or participating in a teaching project. It is such selfless joy
that should distinguish your community.
This is not to say that material means are not necessary.
Clearly some financial resources will have to be channeled
into each cluster when it reaches a certain level of development, and some funds may need to go towards the subsidies
of a few individual believers who are charged with duties
related to administration and coordination, but are lacking
the personal material means that would allow them to
provide such full-time services without financial support.
However, if such subsidies are given to perform the kinds of
services that the institute process is preparing the generality
of the believers to carry out as part of the natural unfoldment of Bahá’í community life, for example conducting
devotional meetings and children’s classes, confusion will
set in and the promise for growth will remain unfulfilled.
In general, the utmost wisdom and care will have to be exercised in channeling resources into the clusters; otherwise
budgets will soon reach unsustainable proportions, and the
entire enterprise will become prohibitively expensive.10

48.19

48.20

Not only is the flow of financial resources into the cluster
an immediate concern. So, too, is the need to channel contributions from the cluster to the regional or state level and up to the
national level. A letter written on behalf of the House of Justice
warmly acknowledged the efforts of the National Assembly of
India to think about this two-way flow:

48.20

48.21

Obviously only in those states that have attained a certain level of growth will you want to open up the possibility
of having the State Treasurer appoint a trustworthy person
in each of the more advanced clusters to serve as his or her
assistant. It is understood from the document submitted to
you by Mr. . . . that such an assistant would be primarily
responsible for collecting and forwarding contributions to
the State Council and for disbursing funds to the Cluster
Growth Committee on behalf of the Treasurer. This is a
promising idea, and you are advised to make sure the plan
of action takes a systematic approach to its implementation. The House of Justice will look forward to learning
about your experience in this regard.11

48.21

304

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts
48.22

From the passage above it becomes clear that “related to
the judicious use of material resources at the cluster level is
the question of the administration of funds at all levels of the
community—the national level, including the National Spiritual
Assembly and its agency [for human resource development], the
regional level and the local level.”12 It is in this light that the
following was written on behalf of the House of Justice:

48.22

48.23

As the growth of the Faith steadily gathers momentum
in country after country, and provisions are put in place
to sustain the processes of expansion and consolidation in
clusters around the world, the question of sound financial
management by National Spiritual Assemblies and their
agencies assumes increasing importance. Specifically, it
seems that, if some National Assemblies are to succeed
in taking advantage of the tremendous opportunities
now presenting themselves, they will require assistance in
developing their capacity to manage their fiscal affairs and
in refining a financial system which ensures efficiency, transparency and accountability at all levels of the community,
from the national to the local.13

48.23

48.24

But the flow of material resources to and from the cluster
is not the only one requiring attention. Equally important is
the flow of information, largely in the form of statistics. The
following paragraph from a letter written by the Department
of Statistics at the World Centre to several National Assemblies
explains the nature of a computer application designed to assist
in maintaining this flow of information:

48.24

48.25

The program, referred to as the “Statistical Report
Program,” is conceived on the premise that a country is
divided into clusters, most of which consist of a number of
local communities. When the program is fully operational in
a country, the membership and other data for each locality
will be collected and recorded at the cluster level, transmitted to the regional and national levels, and eventually to the
Bahá’í World Centre, where it will be incorporated into the
worldwide statistics on the Bahá’í community. It is hoped
that adopting this system will foster a dynamic process in
which membership and locality records are continually
being updated and the information shared from one level to
the next. In this sense, the program is intended to provide a
picture of the current situation at a given date (a statistical

48.25

305

Turning Point

snapshot) in a locality, cluster, region, or country, and not a
historical record. The program can generate a set of reports
at every level and thus be used as a tool for monitoring and
planning growth.14
48.26

In a recent letter written on behalf of the House of Justice
to the National Assembly of Germany, the significance of this
flow of information is underscored:

48.26

48.27

In this connection, the House of Justice understands
that you are among a small number of National Spiritual
Assemblies that have achieved an accurate baseline of data
on their communities in the Statistical Report Program, the
instrument designed here at the World Centre for collecting
and maintaining statistics from the cluster to the national
levels. You are commended for this achievement and are
encouraged to ensure that the information provided by
the program is used as a means for keeping abreast of the
developments in the community at all levels and for guiding
it accordingly.15

48.27

48.28

It is important to note from the above that the House of
Justice views both the flow of material resources and information as a means of supporting the work of the Faith at the grassroots. Further, what is becoming clear is that the administration
at each level of the community is directly affected by the one
below it. “It is quite likely that by looking to the requirements
at the regional level,” a letter written on behalf of the House
of Justice has advised, “you will gain a better idea of how the
practices and procedures at the national level should be established.”16 In this connection, the National Assembly of India
was encouraged to proceed with plans to begin examining its
administrative machinery at the cluster level and to observe

48.28

48.29

. . . the workings of the new structures you are putting in
place to support the processes of expansion and consolidation, with the aim of determining their implications for the
administrative affairs of the State Bahá’í Councils and then,
of course, for the operation of your National Center and
the functioning of your national agencies.17

48.29

48.30

Clearly, then, the refinement of the administrative machinery at the regional and national levels is another area of learning that will need to receive increasing attention. The passage
below from a letter dated 27 May 2005 written on behalf of

48.30

306

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

the House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Russian Federation offers insights in this respect. Noting that
“with the division of countries into small geographic areas,
clusters have become a new arena of activity,” the letter explains that “in practical terms, this means that many decisions
having to do with the expansion and consolidation of the Faith
are now made at that level.” It goes on to state,
48.31

48.32

48.33

With such far-reaching developments occurring at
the cluster level, the strengthening of Regional Bahá’í
Councils takes on special significance. You yourself have
recognized that it would indeed be difficult in a country
as widespread and diverse as Russia for your Assembly to
be in close and continual contact with communities and
believers. The Regional Councils, on the other hand, have
an intimate knowledge of the resources of the believers in
their regions, the capacity of the local Bahá’í communities,
and the capabilities of the Local Spiritual Assemblies. As
they assume increasing responsibility for the promotion of
the Faith within their regions, they will continue to grow
in their ability to analyze the strengths and needs in their
areas and, based on this analysis, to devise ways to assist
in the implementation of the Plan. It is thus in the effective
functioning of the Regional Councils that the House of
Justice feels the answers to your concerns lie.
At the national level, your Assembly has the responsibility to reinforce the efforts of the Regional Bahá’í Councils
to carry out their challenging duties. This will involve
keeping a loving and watchful eye over them, providing
encouragement and guidance when needed, ensuring the
availability of basic literature, augmenting their financial
resources to take care of their ever-expanding activities, and
implementing an efficient system for the collection and dissemination of statistics—that is to say, serving the manifold
needs of the Regional Councils with the aim of empowering
them to act with confidence and efficiency. Regional Bahá’í
Councils will, of course, go through various stages of
development; some will initially require a greater degree of
direction, while others can even now function with a wide
degree of latitude.18
It is within the context of such weighty responsibilities
that the Universal House of Justice described to one National
307

48.31

48.32

48.33

Turning Point

Spiritual Assembly some of the characteristics of those to be
appointed as members of Regional Bahá’í Councils:
48.34

As you know, the [Regional] Bahá’í Councils have a
crucial role to play in the effective prosecution of the Five
Year Plan. Your greatly blessed community, standing among
the front ranks of the supporters of Bahá’u’lláh in Africa, is
already moving a sizeable number of clusters to the point
where intensive programs of growth can be established and
sustained. The next Plan must witness a further multiplication of this number. It is therefore vital that the National
Assembly exercise wisdom in its selection of the members of
the Councils from among the nominees, both those elected
by members of Local Spiritual Assemblies and those recommended by the Auxiliary Board members. With the specific
duties of the Councils in mind, you should choose those
women and men who, through their proven experience in
the activities of the Plan, their capacity to participate in the
learning process, and their upright character and constructive attitudes, can best advance the process of entry by
troops in the various provinces. Much will depend on the
quality of your deliberations, which should be carried out
in a true Bahá’í spirit, standing humbly in the presence of
Bahá’u’lláh, forgoing self-interest and all partisan concerns,
and thinking only of the best interests of the Faith that you
all hold dear.19

48.34

48.35

Of course, not all countries have the conditions necessary
to warrant the establishment of Regional Bahá’í Councils.
Irrespective, it is the task of all National Spiritual Assemblies
“to decide how to deploy the resources it has available to it
at any time.”20 Whether a country is large or small, whether
its current set of activities is relatively simple or complex,
the National Assembly needs to give careful consideration to
administrative arrangements at the national level. “While every
Assembly must guard against over-administration,” the House
of Justice has explained, “it is essential for a degree of administrative work to be performed in order to coordinate and assist
the work of expansion and consolidation and carry out other
essential functions at the national level.”21 In this connection,
the House of Justice provided the following comments to the
National Spiritual Assembly of the United States:

48.35

308

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts
48.36

48.37

Commitment to establishing sound intensive programs
of growth in a realistic number of clusters across the
nation should provide the basis for addressing the many
questions associated with the necessary adjustment of your
administrative and financial affairs to meet the challenges
of massive expansion. . . . In considering the nature of these
mechanisms, you will want to bear certain points in mind.
With learning about the nature of growth unfolding so
rapidly at the grassroots, programs related to the expansion
and consolidation of the Faith can best be managed at the
regional or cluster level to ensure they evolve in accordance
with practical experience. The efforts of national agencies
should be examined to determine whether they overlap
with the responsibilities granted to agencies at those levels.
Where redundancies occur, the programs of national agencies may need to be modified significantly, or perhaps be
eliminated altogether, so as to avoid creating confusion,
diffusing focus, or dividing participation among an array
of programs which, no matter how valuable in themselves,
would end up at cross purposes, competing for the limited
time and energies of the believers.22

Learning to Plan and to Mobilize

49.1

Referring to the planning process, the Universal House of
Justice has stated that “at its core it is a spiritual process in
which communities and institutions strive to align their pursuits
with the Will of God.”1 The Major Plan and Minor Plan of
God, it has explained, are “the two known ways in which His
purpose for humankind is going forward. The Major Plan is
associated with turbulence and calamity and proceeds with
an apparent, random disorderliness, but is, in fact, inexorably
driving humanity towards unity and maturity. Its agency for the
most part is the people who are ignorant of its course and even
antagonistic towards its aim. . . . Unlike His Major Plan, which
works mysteriously, God’s Minor Plan is clearly delineated,
operates according to orderly and well-known processes, and
has been given to us to execute. Its ultimate goal is the Most
Great Peace.”2 The Minor Plan unfolds in stages, each of which
is governed by a global Plan articulated by the Head of the
Faith. “It is to the achievement of its purpose,” the House of
Justice has indicated, “that we must all devote our attention
and energies.”3 In its 9 January 2001 message, the House of
Justice referred specifically to the role of the institutions in
ensuring that this purpose is achieved:

49.1

49.2

The Major Plan of God is at work and the forces it generates impel humanity towards its destiny. In their own plans
of action, the institutions of the Faith must seek to gain
insight into the operation of these great forces, explore the
potentialities of the people they serve, measure the resources
and strengths of their communities, and take practical steps
to enlist the unreserved participation of the believers.4

49.2

49.3

The planning process, in this sense, begins with the global
Plans delineated by the Universal House of Justice. These global
Plans set the direction for the Bahá’í world and provide the

49.3

311

Turning Point

­basis for the formulation of national plans by National Spiritual
Assemblies in consultation with the Counsellors. Planning
then moves down to the regional, cluster and local levels, as
explained in “The Institution of the Counsellors”:
49.4

49.5

49.6

49.7

With the opening of the fourth epoch of the Formative
Age, a procedure was activated whereby national plans are
formulated in joint consultation between National Spiritual
Assemblies and Continental Counsellors. This development
ensures two significant benefits: It enables each institution
to draw on the experience and insight particular to the
other, thereby making available to the planning process two
distinct channels of information from two levels of Bahá’í
administration; and it also assures to the Counsellors a
necessary familiarity with the background, rationale, and
content of national plans, which as a matter of principle
they are expected to support.
Creating a national plan involves far more than consultation between the Counsellors and the National Assembly.
Excellent results can be achieved, for example, by holding
consultative meetings among the various institutions in
a country and with the active supporters of the Faith to
discuss fully the possible provisions of the plan and their
implications. Once the major elements of the national plan
have been identified, it is desirable for the planning process
to move quickly to the regional level, and subsequently to
the level of smaller areas and finally to the local community.
The balance that can be achieved in this process between
nationally sponsored campaigns and grassroots efforts is a
necessary condition for success.
National plans, formulated in the context of the global
plans of the Faith, serve as the framework within which
the friends can undertake action. Through them, National
Assemblies not only set goals to be pursued by themselves
and their agencies, but also give direction to the believers, define for them priorities and areas of action, and
elicit from them wholehearted response to the directives
of the Universal House of Justice. Accordingly, they adopt
measures to provide resources—literature, pioneers and
traveling teachers, regional and national events, and funds
as required—to support the initiatives of the friends.
The plans of action that Regional Councils, Area
Teaching Committees and Local Spiritual Assemblies
312

49.4

49.5

49.6

49.7

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

devise in the ensuing process need to go beyond the mere
enumeration of goals to include an analysis of approaches
to be adopted and lines of action to be followed. Indeed,
at this level, planning and implementation must go hand in
hand. If learning is to be the primary mode of operation in
a community, then visions, strategies, goals and methods
have to be reexamined time and again. As tasks are accomplished, obstacles removed, resources multiplied and
lessons learned, modifications have to be made in goals
and approaches, but in a way that continuity of action is
maintained.5
49.8

In a letter dated 12 December 2001 written on its behalf to
the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, the House
of Justice described, in the specific context of the Five Year
Plan, how the plan formulated at a given level is embedded in
the plan above it:

49.8

49.9

Plans for the growth of the Faith are required at several
distinct levels, each embedded in the level above it and each
serving a specific purpose. A national plan is elaborated in
the context of the global plan, whose features are set forth
by the Universal House of Justice. Through it, the National
Spiritual Assembly provides an overall vision of the tasks to
be accomplished, defines the areas of action to be pursued,
and elicits from the believers wholehearted response to the
directives of the Universal House of Justice. In its letter to
you of 28 June 2001, the House of Justice expressed its
pleasure at reading your national plan, which offers a clear
framework within which the various components of the
community can carry out their activities during the Five
Year Plan.
It would, of course, be counterproductive for a
Regional Council to design a plan of a similar kind, or to
operate outside the context of the national plan. Here what
is required is an analysis of the specific approaches to be
adopted and a determination of the lines of action to be
followed. In the case of the Five Year Plan, a regional plan
consists essentially of those provisions needed to help each
cluster in the region move from its current stage of growth
to the next advanced stage. Such a plan identifies priorities
and sets objectives for a given period of time—certain clusters to be opened to the Faith, others to be strengthened,

49.9

49.10

313

49.10

Turning Point

49.11

and, in those deemed ready, intensive growth programs to
be established. This implies that the Regional Council will
base its plan on a categorization of the clusters in the region
according to their current stage of development. Such a
categorization should not be misconstrued as a judgment
on the quality of local communities. It should be regarded,
rather, as a means through which realistic strategies for
growth can be devised and executed.
Detailed plans of action, with specific goals and the corresponding methods, rightly belong to the level of the cluster.
While the institute process will constitute the engine for
growth in all clusters, a diversity of action is bound to appear
at this level. This diversity will be a natural outcome of plans
of action that take into account the particular resources of
the believers, the capacity of the local Bahá’í communities,
and the strength of the Local Spiritual Assemblies.6

49.11

49.12

Clearly, plans devised at each level serve different purposes
and have different elements. Those closest to the grassroots are
concerned as much with implementation and action as they are
with planning. Of course, the concept of the cluster was introduced during the Five Year Plan precisely with this in mind. “It
should be remembered,” a letter written on behalf of the House
of Justice noted, “that ‘clusters’ are only a construct—albeit a
highly useful one—that enables the friends to think about the
growth of the Faith on a manageable scale and to design and
implement plans close to the grassroots of the community.”7
At the current stage of development of the Bahá’í world, then,
the cluster has proven to be a useful unit, in terms of size, for
organizing the work of the Faith and mobilizing the believers
so that growth can be realized:

49.12

49.13

With the division of countries into small geographic areas,
clusters have become a new arena of activity, within which
the training institutes are enhancing the capacity of an
increasing number of believers to promote expansion and
consolidation to the point where they are able to launch intensive programs of growth. One of the welcome outcomes
of this process has been the sense of ownership exercised
by the believers and institutions serving within the cluster.
In practical terms, this means that many decisions having
to do with the expansion and consolidation of the Faith are
now made at that level.8

49.13

314

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts
49.14

Plans of action at the level of the cluster, then, are able
to take into account conditions on the ground. Central to the
success of such plans is, of course, the question of human resources. As indicated in the above passage, the training institute
is an important element in mobilizing the friends. A message
written by the House of Justice at the start of the Four Year
Plan underscored the part the training institute would need to
play in this mobilization:

49.14

49.15

Your past exploits were largely the result of the incessant labors of a comparatively few consecrated believers
who devoted their time and resources to the spread of
the Cause in locality after locality. If you are to sustain
rapid expansion and consolidation in the coming years, it is
imperative that far greater numbers of dedicated and committed souls arise to promote these twin processes. Training
courses—widespread, regular and well-organized—constitute the most effective means to mobilize believers on the
scale required.9

49.15

49.16

Another message indicated that “plans focusing on these
areas of large-scale expansion will necessarily seek to mobilize
an appreciable number of believers within each population
not only to labor diligently in their own local communities,
but also to serve as long- and short-term pioneers and visiting
teachers in other localities.” “Training programs,” the message
went on to say, “constitute a most potent instrument for the
accomplishment of such a vast mobilization.”10 It is of course
the institutions of the Faith that are charged with directing this
mobilization and deploying the human resources developed by
the training institute:

49.16

49.17

As the believers advance through the sequence of
courses and their skills and abilities are enhanced, the
responsibility will then fall on you and your other agencies
to see that their energies and talents are channeled in some
form of active service to the Faith. Ample opportunities
should be given to them to put into practice what they
have learned, and in this connection, you will need to create within your community an encouraging environment,
one in which the friends feel empowered to step forward,
whatever their capacities may be, and take up the work of
the Faith.11

49.17

315

Turning Point
49.18

In addition to capitalizing on the capacities and talents of
the friends, the institutions must, then, encourage them and
help them to maintain clarity of vision if they are to successfully
marshal their forces. Several National Spiritual Assemblies were
counseled during the Four Year Plan:

49.18

49.19

What each of you must now ensure is that your community
presses onward with clarity of vision and undiminished
zeal. You should make every effort to see that, through the
operation of your training institutes, the base of the human
resources of each of your communities is steadily extended.
While the number of those entering your institute programs
increases, so too must the number of friends reaching the
higher courses in the sequences you each have chosen.
Cultivate an atmosphere of love in your communities and
help the friends to become a source of encouragement to
one another. Take every opportunity to focus the believers
on the aim of the Four Year Plan. Do all within your powers to assist them in the field of action.12

49.19

49.20

Likewise, the institutions need to maintain enthusiasm and
help the friends to set goals for themselves:

49.20

49.21

As a growing number of believers progress through the
­i nstitute courses, the responsibility will fall on your
Assembly, as well as the Local Spiritual Assemblies, to see
that their enthusiasm is maintained. They will need to be
assisted in setting goals for themselves and be encouraged
to persevere in their endeavors until teaching becomes the
dominating passion of their lives and they gain confidence in
their ability to make a distinctive contribution towards the
achievement of the central aim of the Four Year Plan.13

49.21

49.22

Bringing these elements together to mobilize the friends in
the field of service, then, is a capacity that must be developed
in the institutions. What has become apparent during the Five
Year Plan is that the reflection meeting provides the institutions with the instrument they need to mobilize the friends in
this way, as explained in the 17 January 2003 message of the
Universal House of Justice:

49.22

49.23

Meetings of consultation held at the cluster level serve to
raise awareness of possibilities and generate enthusiasm.
Here, free from the demands of formal decision-making,
participants reflect on experience gained, share insights,

49.23

316

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts

explore approaches and acquire a better understanding of
how each can contribute to achieving the aim of the Plan.
In many cases, such interaction leads to consensus on a set
of short-term goals, both individual and collective.14
49.24

As the above passage suggests, the reflection meeting at the
cluster level serves a twofold purpose. Not only does it provide
a means for mobilizing the believers, but it also contributes
greatly to the planning process. This is true whether the cluster
is in an early stage of development or whether it has reached
an advanced stage, in which cycles of activities are carried out
as part of an intensive program of growth:

49.24

49.25

. . . the meetings of reflection called at various intervals
during the cycles should serve to reinforce an attitude of
learning among the participants in the program so that any
fear of failure or criticism gives way to the joy of earnest
striving. To achieve this, the friends involved in organizing
the meetings should recognize that guided, participatory
discussion can prove more instructive than elaborate presentations and prolonged theoretical analyses. A careful
review of vital statistics, which highlight weaknesses that
require remedial attention and point to strengths that can
be built upon in the next cycle of activity, will go far in
facilitating the planning process.15

49.25

49.26

In this way, planning is a flexible process that is able to
take advantage of rapidly changing circumstances. With so
much organization being done in reflection meetings at the
cluster level, one question that has arisen is whether “the plans
arrived at through such consultations require ratification by the
Local Assemblies before implementation can begin.”16 To this
question, the House of Justice provided the following answer
in a letter dated 9 December 2001:

49.26

49.27

As a matter of principle, any plans carried out in the
jurisdiction of a Local Spiritual Assembly should meet with
its approval. That being said, we are asked to point out that
the planning process called for during the Five Year Plan,
with its emphasis on the development of small geographic
areas, allows for a great deal of flexibility. The Universal
House of Justice hopes that the consultations which take
place in periodic meetings at the level of the cluster will
generate such unity of thought about the growth of the Faith

49.27

317

Turning Point

that, in those cases where the lines of action affect localities
with Local Assemblies, the requirement of receiving their
approval will easily be met. It should be remembered that
the aim of such consultations, beyond addressing certain
practical considerations, is to maintain a high level of enthusiasm and to create a spirit of service and fellowship among
those present. Discussions should not become bogged down
by undue concern for procedural issues, but should focus on
what can be achieved and on the joy of witnessing the fruits
of hard work and diligent effort.17
49.28

In another letter dated 11 April 2005 written on its behalf, the
Universal House of Justice has given this further clarification:

49.28

49.29

Activity at the level of the cluster is instilling a sense of
unity and a spirit of service among the friends within units
larger than the local community. Reflection meetings, which
are an essential element of this endeavor, should certainly
not be seen to exclude Local Spiritual Assemblies or to
minimize the role of their designated functions, but, it is
hoped, to include them in a highly collective enterprise,
developing a more comprehensive sense of movement on a
wide scale that is motivated by a greater understanding of
the broad vision of the Faith.18

49.29

49.30

In this light, the work at the cluster level serves to reinforce the efforts of well-functioning, strong Local Spiritual
Assemblies:

49.30

49.31

All of this opens thrilling opportunities for Local
Spiritual Assemblies. Theirs is the challenge, in collaboration with the Auxiliary Board members who counsel and
assist them, to utilize the energies and talents of the swelling human resources available in their respective areas of
jurisdiction both to create a vibrant community life and to
begin influencing the society around them.19

49.31

49.32

Auxiliary Board members are called upon “to work closely
with these Assemblies, both in the formulation of plans and in
their execution, helping them to shoulder the responsibility of
systematic growth in their own communities and in localities
adopted as extension goals.”20 It is this collaborative relationship that provides inspiration to the friends and elicits from
them wholehearted response to plans:

49.32

318

Global Plans: Fundamental Concepts
49.33

Acting in their respective roles, the two institutions of
the Counsellors and the Spiritual Assemblies share responsibility for the protection and propagation of the Faith. The
harmonious interaction between them ensures the constant
flow of guidance, love and encouragement to the believers
and invigorates their individual and collective endeavors to
advance the Cause.21

49.33

49.34

Since Board members also work intimately with the training institute and Area Teaching Committee, they can ensure
that the endeavors of such well-functioning Local Spiritual
Assemblies are in accordance with plans of action at the level
of the cluster. This is especially critical in the case of clusters
that have become the focus of intensive programs of growth,
through which all the institutions must learn “to support the
initiatives of individuals and merge diverse efforts into a powerful collective thrust.”22 Of course, in most cases the work of the
Board members is “not carried out in the context of communities that enjoy the leadership of a mature Spiritual Assembly.”23
Rather they work, with the help of their assistants, in localities
where the Assemblies are not yet functioning at the necessary
level, as described by the House of Justice in “The Institution
of the Counsellors”:

49.34

49.35

In a community where the Local Assembly is at the very
early stages of its development, the role of the assistants in
promoting the establishment of study groups, devotional
meetings, classes for the spiritual education of children, and
the Nineteen Day Feast is even more crucial. Further, the
Auxiliary Board members give attention to strengthening
the Local Spiritual Assemblies, helping them to master the
art of consultation, to gain confidence in making decisions,
to adhere courageously to principle, and to learn how to
mobilize the friends in unified action.24

49.35

49.36

Whatever stage of growth the localities in a cluster have
reached, the Auxiliary Board members “play a vital part in
encouraging the friends”25 and “take it upon themselves to
ensure that proper attention is devoted to the various components of the community,”26 that is, to every man, woman,
youth and child. The latter two offer a special challenge. Board
members “keep before everyone’s eyes the imperative of the
spiritual education of children and do everything in their power
to help establish and maintain regular classes for the children.

49.36

319

Turning Point

And, with ­ complete confidence in the capacity of youth for
heroic service to the Cause, they assist them in realizing their
full potential as vital agents for the expansion of the Faith and
the transformation of society.”27 The Universal House of Justice
has repeatedly called upon the institutions to “give consistent
attention to involving the youth in the expansion and consolidation work.”28 In this connection, it stressed at the start of the
Four Year Plan:
49.37

Youth will undoubtedly be the most enthusiastic
­supporters of the programs of your institutes. They are
eager to make a significant contribution to the progress
of their communities and have shown, time and again,
their capacity to respond to the call to service. They can
be trained to help shoulder the manifold responsibilities
demanded by rapid expansion and consolidation. But it is
especially important for large numbers of them to become
capable teachers of Bahá’í children’s classes. As you are well
aware, without the education of children it is impossible to
maintain victories from one generation to the next.29

49.37

49.38

With this in mind, the House of Justice has advised that
“strategies to advance the process of entry by troops cannot
ignore children and junior youth.”30 Junior youth, of course,
“represent a special group with special needs as they are
somewhat in between childhood and youth when many changes
are occurring within them.”31 The Bahá’í world will be focused
on the aim of advancing the process of entry by troops until
the end of the first century of the Faith’s Formative Age, when
today’s children and junior youth will be young adults—the
future teachers and administrators of the Faith. Auxiliary
Board members have been urged to ensure that the friends
raised up by training institutes are mobilized “to meet the
spiritual requirements of children and junior youth.”32 “The
youth, in particular, constitute a vast reservoir of energy and
talent,”33 the House of Justice has indicated. “Developing and
utilizing this immensely valuable resource”34 to meet the needs
of children and junior youth, specifically, and to further the aim
of the global Plans, in general, is surely one of the most pressing
challenges ahead.

the Universal
House of Justice indicated that, with the launch of the Four
Year Plan at Rid.ván 1996, the Bahá’í world set out on “a
path of intense learning about the sustained, rapid growth of
the Faith.” At different points along the way since then, effort
has been made at the international level of the community to
distill the learning taking place at the grassroots and to diffuse
the knowledge thus acquired in documents widely circulated
to the friends. Part III includes four documents of this kind.
The first, entitled “Training Institutes,” was prepared for and
approved by the Universal House of Justice in 1998. The next
two, both similar to the first, were written by the International
Teaching Centre at the instruction of the House of Justice.
“Training Institutes and Systematic Growth” was released in
2000 and “Building Momentum: A Coherent Approach to
Growth” in 2003. The final document presents an analysis by
the Teaching Centre of the experience of the Bahá’í world in
meeting the administrative challenges associated with largescale expansion. Entitled “Impact of Growth on Administration
Processes,” it was prepared in July 2005.

The Four Year Plan calls for a significant advance in the process
of entry by troops to be supported and sustained by the systematic development of human resources. In the messages of the
Universal House of Justice on the Plan, the training institute is
envisaged as an instrument crucial to this development.
The purpose of the present document is twofold. On the
one hand, it offers an overview of the efforts thus far made by
the worldwide Bahá’í community to establish institutes; on the
other, it reviews their accomplishments to date and explores
their possibilities for further development and potential effect
on the process of entry by troops. Passages from the relevant
guidance given by the House of Justice provide the framework
for the study undertaken. The document is divided into three
sections:
1. Awareness of the Importance of Training
2. Enhancement of Institutional Capacity
2.1 Institutes in small communities with a large
percentage of knowledgeable believers
 Teacher training programs
 Instruments of teaching
2.2 Institutes in communities which witnessed largescale expansion prior to the Plan, but whose
human resources remained exceedingly low
2.3 Institutes in communities which, having experienced
large-scale expansion, had already acquired
some capacity for training prior to the Plan

1. Awareness of the Importance of Training
50.3

In the two years since the launching of the Four Year Plan,
considerable progress has been made in raising the friends’
awareness of the need for training. As a result, the rigorous
and methodical study of the writings, a habit that required reinforcement in many communities, has assumed prominence. This
is a welcome development, but more has to be accomplished
before the implications of systematic training are fully grasped.
The Universal House of Justice explains:

50.3

50.4

With the growth in the number of enrollments, it has
become apparent that such occasional courses of instruction and the informal activities of community life, though
important, are not sufficient as a means of human resource
development, for they have resulted in only a relatively
small band of active supporters of the Cause. These believers, no matter how dedicated, no matter how willing to
make sacrifices, cannot attend to the needs of hundreds,
much less thousands, of fledgling local communities.
Systematic attention has to be given by Bahá’í institutions
to training a significant number of believers and assisting
them in serving the Cause according to their God-given
talents and capacities.1

50.4

50.5

In many parts of the world, attention is focused largely
on gaining an understanding of the fundamental verities of
the Faith. The corresponding institute programs cover a wide
range of subjects aimed at deepening the friends’ knowledge of
various aspects of the teachings. To be effective in developing
human resources, these programs need to impart knowledge,
provide spiritual insights, and endow the participants with
skills and abilities of service. In the messages on the Four Year

50.5

324

Additional Documents
Plan, the House of Justice has made a number of statements
on the nature of training, and the variations in wording lend
perspective on this complex matter:
50.6

The purpose of such training is to endow ever-growing
contingents of believers with the spiritual insights, the
knowledge, and the skills needed to carry out the many
tasks of accelerated expansion and consolidation, including the teaching and deepening of a large number of
people—adults, youth and children.2

50.6

50.7

It is therefore of paramount importance that systematic
attention be given to devising methods for educating large
numbers of believers in the fundamental verities of the
Faith and for training and assisting them to serve the Cause
as their God-given talents allow.3

50.7

50.8

They [training institutes] will help to develop in each participant a deep love for Bahá’u’lláh, a good understanding
of His essential Teachings and an awareness of the importance of developing the spiritual life of each individual
through prayer, meditation and immersion in the Sacred
Writings. They will also cover such practical matters as
how to teach the Faith, for there are too many who, for
lack of confidence in their ability to do so, are hesitant to
convey the Message.4

50.8

50.9

Your participation in institute programs, through which
you will deepen your knowledge of the Faith, cultivate your
inner spiritual lives and develop abilities of service, will
enable you to intensify your individual and collective exertions in the teaching field and will result in a commensurate
acceleration in the expansion of your communities.5

50.9

50.10

They [institute programs] should seek to develop in the
participants a good understanding of Bahá’u’lláh’s essential
Teachings and to help them acquire those skills and abilities
that will enable them to serve the Faith effectively. They
should also strive to imbue their hearts with a deep love for
Bahá’u’lláh—a love from which stems a desire to submit
oneself to His Will, to obey His laws, to heed His exhortations and to promote His Faith.6

50.10

50.11

These centers of Bahá’í learning will have as their goal
one very practical outcome, namely, the raising up of large

50.11

325

Turning Point

numbers of believers who are trained to foster and facilitate
the process of entry by troops with efficiency and love.7
50.12

Passages such as these define a clear purpose for training
institutes. The experience of the past two years indicates that
when institute programs fulfill this purpose through curricula
that properly integrate the various components of training, the
number of those who dedicate themselves to the work of the
Faith increases dramatically.

50.12

2. Enhancement of Institutional Capacity
50.13

Most national communities have taken the necessary
initial steps to establish one or more training institutes in their
countries. Boards or committees to oversee the operation of the
institutes have been appointed. Patterns of cooperation between
the Counsellors and the National Spiritual Assemblies in this
vital area of activity have been adopted. Working relationships
between Auxiliary Board members and the institutes have not
proven difficult to build. By now, institutes in almost all countries have successfully conducted a few training sessions. Some
are at the stage of offering regular courses to relatively small
groups, while others have gone further to establish elaborate
systems to reach large numbers. To significantly enhance the
institutional capacity of each national community so as to
impart spiritual education to ever-increasing contingents of
believers is a challenge that requires persistent attention. In a
memorandum to the International Teaching Centre, the House
of Justice explains:

50.13

50.14

From the various reports received at the World Centre, it
is clear that a great deal of institutional capacity needs to
be created in most national communities for training on
a large scale. In many countries, offering regular courses
to relatively small groups of believers is a formidable
challenge. The Counsellors with the encouragement of the
International Teaching Centre will need to devote considerable energy to helping national communities progress step
by step along the way, if the believers of capacity in the
villages and towns of the world are to receive training and
we are to witness the kind of development in the Faith for
which we hope.8

50.14

326

Additional Documents
50.15

The greatest progress in this direction has been made in
those national communities which have concentrated on the
execution of programs, not allowing themselves to be diverted
from action by lengthy discussions of theoretical matters. Their
institutes have expeditiously chosen a series of courses with the
best methods and materials available to them, trained teachers,
and set out to build their systems of delivery in the process of
implementation:

50.15

50.16

In this connection, it brought the House of Justice
much satisfaction to note in the program proposal for the
development of human resources, sent to the World Centre
in December, that a sequence of a few basic courses had
already been defined, which would be conducted using
available materials. In this way, emphasis could be placed
on the execution of the program. The House of Justice is
concerned that much time will be lost if the program coordinator is now asked to devote attention to ensuring that
the institute offers courses to cover a wide range of training
requirements. What is needed at this stage is to train scores
of facilitators in how to conduct the first few courses, so that
they can offer them in the villages and towns throughout
the country, enabling thereby hundreds and eventually
thousands to enter the institute’s program. Such a task is, in
and of itself, formidable and will require tremendous focus
and concentration on the part of the institute.9

50.16

50.17

The following extract from a letter written on behalf of the
House of Justice to an individual believer also addresses this
point:

50.17

50.18

That after so many years of constant effort throughout the
Bahá’í world methods and approaches have been found to
train at least a certain number of believers enrolled from
among the receptive masses themselves—to deepen their
knowledge of the Teachings of the Faith and to help them
acquire skills and abilities to serve it effectively—is no
small accomplishment, and these methods and approaches
should now be fully exploited and utilized more extensively.
Therefore, the emphasis on the establishment and operation of training institutes in the Four Year Plan is not only
the expression of a great need in the Faith but also an
acknowledgement of the capacity within the worldwide
Bahá’í community to meet it on a large scale.10

50.18

327

Turning Point
50.19

Three patterns can be discerned according to which
institutional capacity for training seems to be developing in the
Bahá’í world.

50.19

2.1 Small communities with a large percentage
of knowledgeable believers
50.20

50.21

One pattern is generally associated with countries where
the number of knowledgeable believers in a rather small Bahá’í
population is relatively high. Most of the communities in
Western Europe fall into this category. The approach adopted
by their institutes is for the boards to determine what courses
should be offered and call upon individuals to design and
deliver them. Depending on the size of the country, courses are
held in a central place or repeated in various localities.
There is no doubt that this pattern, if carefully applied, will
lead to a significant increase in human resources. To gradually
develop an educational organization which offers a variety of
courses to a larger and larger student body clearly enhances
institutional capacity in any national community. Like institutes
everywhere, those in this category will become strengthened
as they learn how to motivate, guide and assist their teachers; to attract a steadily growing number of students; and to
administer their courses with efficiency. For this development
to be meaningful, however, a great deal of work has to be done
on program content. The purpose of training, as outlined in
the messages of the House of Justice, is not realized by simply
making it possible for some of the friends to offer courses on
their favorite subjects to groups of interested believers.

50.20

50.21

Teacher training programs 
50.22

What is required of these institutes, then, is to identify in
consultation with a group of collaborators the real needs of
their national communities and address these in well-designed
programs. Given the aim of the Plan, such needs are intimately
related to opportunities for growth in the country. A letter
written on behalf of the House of Justice underscores the role
of such institutes in the promotion of teaching:

50.22

50.23

The House of Justice was heartened to note your goals
related to teaching and hopes that you will give special
consideration to the measures which can immediately be
taken towards the achievement of a progressive increase in

50.23

328

Additional Documents
the number of individual enrollments. In this regard, it will
be of particular importance that the friends are encouraged
to arise and teach the Faith with ever greater determination and courage, and the continued development of your
national training institute will be instrumental in this effort.
At this stage in the growth of your community, the institute
should consider as its primary task the offering of courses
that seek to endow the friends with the knowledge, spiritual
insights, and skills needed not only to proclaim the Cause,
but to guide new souls to Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation.11
50.24

As they strive to work in this way, these institutes face a
difficulty inherent in their communities’ lack of experience in
large-scale expansion, experience upon which they could draw
to design appropriate curricular elements. While their present
strength enables them to formulate with relative ease courses
which impart knowledge of the Faith or examine spiritual and
social issues, they struggle with the content of teacher training programs that would offer practical advice and insights.
Utilizing materials developed in other parts of the world, where
such experience exists, helps overcome this difficulty. The longterm solution, however, is for the appropriate institutions to
establish systematic teaching plans that are approached with
an attitude of learning. Training and teaching, then, become
two parallel processes that fuel each other: Training courses
raise the enthusiasm of the friends for teaching and help them
acquire the necessary skills. Increased experience in the teaching
field is reflected in the constantly improving content of training
courses.

50.24

Instruments of teaching 
50.25

Another dimension of institutional capacity that needs to
be explored more vigorously by these institutes is their role as
direct instruments of teaching:

50.25

50.26

The Universal House of Justice received with great
pleasure a copy of the first quarterly report of the board
of directors of your national training institute. It was
particularly heartened to note that the board is approaching
its tasks with an open attitude towards learning, fully cognizant of the need to make decisions about the content and
methods of the institute program, to implement them, to
reflect on the results, and to make adjustments in the light

of experience. Through such an approach, your institute
will succeed in gradually increasing its capacity to develop
the human resources of the Bulgarian community.
Since your community is relatively small, the board may
wish to consider, as it continues to learn from experience,
designing some courses which could be open to Bahá’ís
and non-Bahá’ís alike. In addition to attracting thoughtful
people to the Cause, such courses could also be a means of
confirming them in the Faith and increasing the number of
Bahá’u’lláh’s faithful followers in your country.12
Given the growing interest among the public in social and
spiritual issues, courses open to non-Bahá’ís could easily address such topics as the meaning of spirituality in a modern
world, moral leadership, the spiritual education of children
and youth, the dynamics of prayer, the nature of the soul and
the afterlife.

50.27

50.28

2.2 Communities of large-scale expansion with
extremely limited human resources
50.29

50.30

A second pattern is emerging mostly in countries which
witnessed large-scale expansion prior to the Four Year Plan,
but whose human resources remained exceedingly low. Here,
the focus of institutes is on conducting courses of fixed duration, running from a few days up to several weeks, covering a
set of basic deepening topics and assisting the participants in
acquiring some skills. Groups of 20 to 30 are usually brought
to a central place and trained, in the hope that they will return
and strengthen their local communities. For these institutes,
learning how to offer a course to group after group and to keep
them enthusiastic day after day is in itself a significant step. It is
heartening to see that a number of them are rapidly acquiring
the capacity to accomplish this task.
In the context of entry by troops, however, institutes that
conduct courses only at a central location have clear limitations. In a country of several thousand believers where a small
group carries much of the weight of the work of the Faith, an
institute course of a few weeks’ duration, repeated four or five
times a year, may double or triple the number of workers in the
field. But this does not provide the human resources to set in
motion a sustainable process of accelerated growth. Once an
institute passes through such a first stage, then, it must face the
330

50.29

50.30

Additional Documents
challenge of reaching a greater number of believers. In several
countries in this category, the friends are already aware of this
need, but for them to acquire the necessary level of institutional
capacity is not proving to be easy. In this connection, the following guidance was offered by the Universal House of Justice
to the International Teaching Centre:
50.31

Now that many institutes have passed through the
initial stage of establishment, the Counsellors can help
increase their efficiency by bringing to their attention the
need to reach larger and larger numbers of students with
their courses. It would be a poor use of limited financial
resources for an institute with a budget which includes remuneration for several full-time staff to offer a few courses
to a handful of believers year after year. But even in this
case, an indicator such as the cost per student per course
would have to be used carefully. Early on, as institutes are
learning how to attract students and offer courses, it is to
be expected that such costs would run relatively high.13

50.31

50.32

Since bringing a very large number of believers to one central location for the purpose of training would be unmanageable, other alternatives have to be found. One option is for the
institute to establish branches in different regions, a possibility
mentioned in the messages on the Four Year Plan. For some
institutes, the creation of one or two branches is feasible at this
stage. To operate many such centers, each with its own facilities
and administrative structure, however, would be beyond the
financial means of most communities:

50.32

50.33

The primary challenge before you is to help hundreds and
then thousands of the believers in Haiti to enter your institute program and study a well-defined sequence of courses.
Clearly, you cannot accomplish this by inviting them all
to one central location. Of course, it would be possible to
establish one or more branches of your national institute.
However, any scheme designed to reach a significant
number of students by establishing many such centers, each
with its own facilities and administrative structure, would
be prohibitively expensive.14

50.33

50.34

It is becoming clear, then, that these institutes need to find
more innovative ways to expand their coverage.

50.34

331

Turning Point

2.3 Communities of large-scale expansion
with some prior capacity for training
50.35

A third notable pattern is unfolding in several national
communities which, having experienced large-scale expansion,
had already acquired some capacity for training prior to the
Four Year Plan. The system being established in these communities, either by a national institute or a nationally coordinated
network of regional institutes, has four components: a sequence
of courses with well-prepared material distributed to every
student, a small study circle usually composed of eight to ten
people, a facilitator or tutor trained to teach the courses, and
some scheme of coordination, both at the national and regional
levels.

50.35

Sequence of courses 
50.36

As experience is gained worldwide, various sequences of
courses will undoubtedly be developed responding to the requirements of divers sectors of society. No one should underestimate the complexity of the task of defining each sequence and
elaborating the materials. These have to adhere to some logic,
if they are to succeed in raising up the needed human resources.
Simply to compile a list of topics the friends should study, in the
light of the guidance available in the writings, is not difficult.
The order in which these topics should be presented, their
correlation with the acquisition of skills to perform acts of
service, and the way their study should be combined with the
cultivation of inner perfection are matters of pedagogy that can
best be discovered through systematic educational experience.
For example, understanding the principles that govern the
establishment and functioning of the Local Spiritual Assembly
is of the utmost importance for every Bahá’í. One must ask,
however, whether a course on this subject is effective when
offered to believers whose knowledge of the Faith is extremely
limited and who have not yet studied those spiritual truths that
shape Bahá’í identity. It is noteworthy that, in practice, when
institutes ignore the relevant pedagogical principles they fail to
maintain the interest of the students, and the level of attendance
in their courses falls.

332

50.36

Additional Documents
Study circles 
50.37

Before the second component of the system, namely, the
study circle, is examined, it should be noted that training institutes are not in charge of deepening the entire community; their
task is to focus on a percentage of the believers who are eager
to learn and willing to teach and deepen others. In response to
an institute proposal which included goals aimed at reaching
the majority of the believers, the following was stated in a letter
written on behalf of the House of Justice:

50.37

50.38

The House of Justice was particularly heartened to see
from your proposal that you intend to form “study circles”
of six to ten believers in the towns and villages throughout
the country, who will go through a series of basic courses
together with a tutor. Through such an approach, you hope
to reach large numbers with your institute program. It
feels, however, that the numerical goals that you have set,
beginning with the third year of the institute’s operation,
are too high. It should be remembered that the purpose of
the institute is to raise up a certain percentage of the friends
as human resources, who, in turn, will teach and deepen the
majority of the believers. Once you have attained the goals
for the first two years, which are themselves ambitious but
achievable, then you can evaluate the situation and set
realistic goals for the third and fourth years.15

50.38

50.39

Institutes in this category try to identify in each locality
eight to ten of the more capable believers, usually young people
with some formal education, and then to help them progress
through the selected sequence of courses. This has proven
possible, even when the generality of the believers are illiterate.
In working with such groups, institutes have learned to avoid
two extremes: underestimating the abilities of the friends and
sacrificing depth to an inordinate desire for simplicity, on the
one hand, and, on the other, expecting too much and overlooking the need to adjust the pace of the courses to the educational
level of the participants.
In those countries where the system described here is
taking shape, much is being learnt about how to motivate
and maintain study circles over an extended period of time.
It is becoming clear, for example, that they must undertake
extra-curricular activities, particularly in the realm of cultural
enrichment. Further, although a group may continue to study

50.39

50.40

333

50.40

Turning Point

50.41

50.42

50.43

50.44

with the same tutor through the entire sequence of courses, it
seems best for each course to have an official beginning and an
event celebrating its successful completion. Some formality is
proving to be essential, but the degree of it varies from country
to country. In some parts of the world, for instance, the culture
seems to respond to, and even demand, examinations and
grades.
An important point to bear in mind is that these study
groups are not local deepening classes or local institutes, but
elements of a system of distance-education administered by a
national or regional institute. The concept of “local institutes”
created some confusion at the beginning of the Four Year Plan,
and the House of Justice offered the following clarification:

50.41

For the establishment of a training institute to be a viable
and worthwhile enterprise, it would clearly have to serve
an area with a reasonably large number of believers.
Moreover, the development of effective curricula to raise
up human resources to carry forward the process of entry
by troops is not, in reality, a task that small local Bahá’í
communities can undertake. Generally speaking, the
resources of a national community, or at least a sizeable
region, need to be drawn upon in devising well-organized,
formally conducted programs. Although it is likely that as
local communities grow, there will be those large enough
to have their own independent institutes, at this point, such
institutes run the danger, as you have surmised, of turning
into deepening classes, which are, of course, of critical importance themselves and an activity every local community
should carry out.
This does not mean, however, that the courses of a
national or regional institute would not be offered at the
local level. In fact, a significant percentage of the national
and regional institutes emerging around the world are
organizing their programs in such a way that many of their
courses are conducted in local communities by believers
trained as teachers or facilitators.16

50.42

As a study group advances through the sequence of courses,
the capacity of each member to serve the Faith increases,
and various institutions and agencies step in and help the
participants to put into practice what they have learned. The

50.44

334

50.43

Additional Documents
following passage from a letter written on behalf of the House
of Justice commends one such effort:
50.45

The plan of action you have devised for the coming months
and the numerical goals you have set, closely correlated
and well-measured, are clear evidence that you have gained
valuable experience during this past year. If you continue
unabated in your efforts, you will steadily increase the
capacity within your national community to accompany
large numbers of believers through a well-defined sequence
of courses, helping them to acquire the needed capabilities
of service. Since the first course in the sequence emphasizes
spiritual identity and prayer, the House of Justice applauds
your decision to increase, parallel to the formation of study
circles, the number of local communities holding regular
devotional meetings. Even in communities where the Local
Spiritual Assembly is not functioning, it should be possible
to establish such meetings through the initiative of those
taking part in the study circles.17

50.45

Tutors 
50.46

The third component of the system under consideration is
the tutor (or facilitator). Such institutes begin their programs by
training several believers, already knowledgeable in the Faith,
as tutors. This makes it possible for them to form study groups
and establish their programs on a firm foundation. Yet the
expansion of the system depends on raising up an ever-growing number of tutors from among the participants themselves.
Here again, the challenge is to strike the right balance. It is
counter-productive to demand so high a quality of work from
tutors that only a few are able to meet the standard, resulting
in a system with inadequate coverage. On the other hand, an
indiscriminate selection of tutors, in which everyone is asked to
form a study group the moment he or she finishes one or two
courses, also proves to be ineffective and leads to the collapse
of the system:

50.46

50.47

Crucial to the success of the institute’s endeavors will
be the effectiveness of its tutors. They themselves will
require training, both in how to facilitate the courses and
maintain the cohesion of the groups studying in the towns
and villages across the country. The institute will need to
make concerted effort, therefore, to build its own capacity

50.47

335

Turning Point

to supervise a growing number of tutors and train them,
constantly improving the quality of their teaching.18
Coordination 
50.48

The fourth component, namely, efficient coordination, is
developed at two levels. At the national level, concern is for
the efficacy of the courses, the fostering of enthusiasm for
training in the country, and the compilation and dissemination
of information regarding the institute, including the number of
participants in the system and the record of their achievements.
At the regional level, closer to the study groups themselves, the
duties of the coordinators include training tutors, following
their progress in the villages and towns, ensuring the availability of materials, and organizing conferences and seminars
for the exchange of experience. With respect to coordination at
the national level, the House of Justice states:

50.48

50.49

It is of the utmost importance, then, that you continue
with unabated zeal and painstaking care to develop the
capacity of your institutes to train growing contingents of
believers. In this regard, you will need to ensure that your
vision for the multiplication of human resources in that vast
land is understood and shared by all those involved in this
vital enterprise and that through various means, such as
the regular dissemination of news of the accomplishments
of your institutes, the friends’ enthusiasm is heightened and
maintained.19

50.49

Integrating the system 
50.50

It should be noted at this point that such a system is not
necessarily put into place at the outset in the way it is described
here. In several countries, the initial strategy has been to deploy
a band of institute teachers in a particular region, assigning to
each a number of towns and villages. The first course of the
institute program is, then, conducted with a group of interested
believers over a period of four or five consecutive days. Upon its
completion, the teacher moves to another locality and repeats
the course with a new group. When the number of those who
have completed the first course is significant, the teachers go
back again to help them study the second course. As the process
advances, capable believers arise from the towns and villages

336

50.50

Additional Documents

50.51

50.52

themselves to act as tutors and form study groups of more
permanence which meet regularly over an extended period.
These four components, methodically developed and
properly integrated, create a system which has proven able
to reach a large number of people at an affordable cost per
student. The following statement from a letter written on behalf
of the House of Justice provides a vision of the growth of such
a system:
The House of Justice was heartened to note that by the
month of October 1997, over 900 believers in Tamil Nadu
had gone through the first course of the national institute
program, and some 200 had succeeded in completing the
second one. It is assumed that a percentage of these will
go on to study the third course, while the number entering
the program will continue to grow. This is indeed a most
promising process of human resource development for a
rapidly expanding community. For the development of
human resources in India may be likened to the building of
an ever-expanding pyramid, whose base must be constantly
broadened. An increasing number of friends are recruited
to enter the first basic course, and relatively significant percentages are then helped to reach higher and higher courses,
acquiring thereby the needed capabilities of service.20

50.51

50.52

2.4 Social and economic development
50.53

It is worth mentioning that, in keeping with the directives
of the House of Justice, the Office of Social and Economic
Development is helping some institutes to add another dimension to their operations, namely, training in the area of development and even the administration of development projects.
For the present, this assistance is limited to a few countries. It
entails raising the institutional capacity of an institute to a new
level, one at which it has a much greater degree of autonomy:

50.53

50.54

Now that the foundations for the next stage of the
institute’s work have been laid, the House of Justice
urges your Assembly to grant the institute the autonomy
needed to function properly. The development of human
resources for expansion and consolidation and for social
and economic development, and the effective management
of development-related projects, are not simple tasks, and

50.54

337

Turning Point

the institute will require freedom of action to learn from its
endeavors in order to consistently improve its work.21
50.55

The addition of this new dimension to the work of institutes is being carried out with great care. Since ­developmentrelated activities often involve funds from non-Bahá’í sources,
a financial system has to be in place to meticulously track
various lines of expenditure. Further, once an institute becomes
engaged in development, it needs to interact with government
agencies and organizations of civil society, often entering into
collaborative relationships with them. All of this demands a
degree of maturity that is achieved only through consistent
effort and experience. In those places where the work is moving
in this direction, the profile of an institution capable of pursuing a highly complex set of activities is beginning to emerge,
and an exciting vision of a dynamic center of learning is taking
shape.

50.55

3. Advancing the Process of Entry by Troops
50.56

A pressing question at the mid-point of the Four Year Plan
is what effect this impressive and rapid development of institutional capacity for the spiritual education of the friends will
have on the process of entry by troops worldwide. Ultimately,
the efficacy of an institute program has to be measured by the
growth of the community being served. But expectations should
remain within reason while the potential of the institute is being
systematically realized. If national communities set their sights
too low and are content with offering a few courses to a limited
number of believers year after year, the required dynamics of
growth will not develop. Yet placing unreasonable demands on
training institutes and those who participate in their programs,
especially at the early stage, would be counter-productive. What
is needed is unrelenting resolve to steadily multiply human
resources, combined with determination to take advantage of
every opportunity for expansion.

50.56

3.1 Increasing human resources
50.57

Clearly measurable results will be achieved only as institutes
succeed in training teachers of the Cause and active workers in
large numbers. What constitutes a significant increase in human
resources, of course, will vary from country to country. In the
338

50.57

Additional Documents
largest Bahá’í community, India, already more than 10,000
believers have studied the first course in the national institute
program. Although this is an extraordinary accomplishment,
the institutions of the Faith in the country are well aware that
to train even ten percent of the total Bahá’í population will
require involving some 200,000 people. While not comparable
to India in size, many national communities throughout the
world have tens of thousands of Bahá’ís, of whom only a small
fraction can at present be counted among the active promoters
of the Faith. For each community to help a relatively significant
number of believers progress through a sequence of courses
represents an enormous challenge. The House of Justice makes
the important point that meeting this challenge—and thus
increasing the number of believers who have a strong Bahá’í
identity and a commitment to teaching the Cause—in itself
constitutes an advance in the process of entry by troops:
50.58

. . . if you are to realize your aspirations for the Cause in
Guyana during the Four Year Plan, you will need to give
further consideration, in consultation with the Counsellors,
to what it means for your community to make a significant
advance in the process of entry by troops. It is understandable that you may not wish to repeat the pattern whereby
you achieved large-scale expansion in the past. Yet, whatever form entry by troops takes in your country in the
future, it is clear that the development of your capacity to
train a certain percentage of the believers for service to the
Cause will be an inescapable imperative. Indeed, given that
only a small fraction of the some 56,000 Bahá’ís in Guyana
can be considered active supporters of the Faith, the very
act of training a few thousand believers, and thus increasing
the number who have a strong Bahá’í identity and a commitment to teaching the Cause, would in itself constitute an
advance in the process of entry by troops.22

50.58

3.2 Accelerating expansion
50.59

An extraordinary opportunity to multiply its human
resources on a vast scale is now clearly within the grasp of the
Bahá’í community. Seizing it will call for added vigilance on
the part of the institutions—the National Spiritual Assemblies
and their agencies, on the one hand, and the Counsellors and
their auxiliaries, on the other—to ensure that the energies of
339

50.59

Turning Point

the friends are channeled into some form of active service to
the Faith:
50.60

. . . as the friends steadily progress through a series of systematic courses, increasing their knowledge and skills, the
responsibility will fall on your Assembly to see that their
energies and talents are channeled in some form of active
service to the Faith. This will have to be done in such a way
that they are neither overburdened with responsibilities
nor under challenged, but are allowed to gradually gain
confidence in their ability to serve and to make a distinctive
contribution towards the achievement of the central aim of
the Four Year Plan.23

50.60

50.61

The immediate result of this multiplication of human
resources will undoubtedly be an increase in teaching activity
undertaken at the initiative of the individual believer, initiative
that needs to be nurtured by the institutions:

50.61

50.62

For your community to grow at a pace commensurate
with the receptivity of the people of Panama, your Assembly
will need to pay close attention to certain fundamental
areas of Bahá’í activity throughout the country. One of the
primary forces that propels growth is teaching undertaken
by the friends on their own initiative. To properly flourish,
however, personal teaching requires stimulation from the
institutions; it must be fostered by National and Local
Spiritual Assemblies, on the one hand, and the Counsellors
and their auxiliaries, on the other. The friends everywhere
need encouragement. Regular gatherings, at various levels,
need to be held to maintain and heighten their enthusiasm
for teaching. Opportunities have to be created for them
to share stories of the successes they have achieved and
the methods they have used, so that they can learn from
one another. Literature and teaching materials must be
made available to them in abundance. Without concerted
efforts of this kind, it is difficult to increase continually the
number of believers arising to discharge their sacred duty
to teach.24

50.62

50.63

Local teaching projects constitute yet another channel
into which the energies of the friends benefiting from institute
programs can be directed:

50.63

340

Additional Documents
50.64

Of equal importance to the promotion of personal
teaching in Peru is the development of local communities,
particularly the enhancement of their capacity to carry out
teaching plans. Working in close collaboration with the
Counsellors, you will need to consider how you can consistently increase the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies
that can design and execute plans which utilize the diverse
talents of the friends, thus multiplying their powers as they
unite in collective action.25

50.64

50.65

Essential as local teaching projects are, however, it should
be realized that, at this point in the history of the Faith, most
believers reside in communities in which the Local Spiritual
Assemblies are but nascent institutions. Therefore, emphasis
has now to be placed, in many countries, on implementing
projects that concentrate on a small region, usually a cluster
of villages with one or two towns. Even though most institutes
have barely begun their work, in more than a few regions the
effects of human resource development are already noticeable
in the enthusiasm for service of groups who have been attending courses. Without doubt, the number of such regions will
multiply rapidly in the months ahead, and it is crucial that
teaching projects be promptly established in any region where
the institute is exerting influence.
For a number of years, the International Teaching Centre
has promoted projects of this kind under the designation
“Long-Term Teaching Project.” As a result, there is now ample
experience in the Bahá’í world which can be readily shared
among national communities through the Counsellors. While
such projects aim at bringing large numbers into the Faith at an
accelerating pace, they are not concerned merely with enrollments; nor is teaching carried out superficially. These projects
involve a complex set of interrelated activities for expansion
and consolidation which, together, result in a steady influx of
new believers. Specifically, every effort is made to incorporate
a significant percentage of the newly enrolled friends immediately into the institute program, extending thereby the human
resource base in the region.
The tasks before the Counsellors and the National Spiritual
Assemblies are multiple and urgent. On the one hand, they
will continue to strengthen the institutes and ensure that an
increasing number of believers benefit from their programs. On
the other, they will support and encourage the friends in their

50.65

Turning Point

individual teaching endeavors, assist Local Spiritual Assemblies
in executing teaching plans, and establish long-term teaching
projects in region after region. All the necessary elements are in
place. The stage is set. There is every reason to believe that the
combined effect of all these efforts will lead to the fulfillment
of the major thrust of the Four Year Plan.

Training Institutes and Systematic Growth
a document prepared by
the International Teaching Centre
February 2000

51.1

In its Rid.ván message of 153 [1996] the Universal House of
Justice placed the establishment and development of training
institutes in the context of the far-reaching changes that would
characterize the progress of the Faith in this period of Bahá’í
history.

51.1

51.2

The next four years will represent an extraordinary period
in the history of our Faith, a turning point of epochal
magnitude. What the friends throughout the world are now
being asked to do is to commit themselves, their material
resources, their abilities and their time to the development
of a network of training institutes on a scale never before
attempted.1

51.2

51.3

As we survey the development of training institutes during
the Four Year Plan, we are struck by the degree to which this
vision has been realized. The network of training institutes
encircling the globe numbers some 350 in 170 countries, with
nearly 100,000 believers having benefited from at least one
institute course. The magnitude of this achievement is rivaled
only by the “untold potential” that it augurs for the advancement of the process of entry by troops.
The purpose of training institutes was clarified and
elaborated in the April 1998 publication entitled “Training
Institutes,” a document prepared for and approved by the
Universal House of Justice. On the basis of this elucidation of
the institute process, national communities began to refocus
their efforts, emphasizing a sequence of courses that would create capacity and commitment on the part of the friends to carry
out acts of service. Greater stress was placed on decentralizing

51.3

51.4

343

51.4

Turning Point

51.5

the institute process so as to reach ever-growing numbers of
believers. The past two years have seen not only the expansion
of training institutes worldwide but a deeper appreciation
throughout the Bahá’í world of the unique and vital role training institutes must play in promoting systematic growth.
This paper presents an overview of the advancement of the
institute process since the release of the April 1998 document.
The analysis is framed in the guidance the House of Justice
has given to National Spiritual Assemblies during the past two
years in relation to training institutes. It is divided into four
sections:

51.5

Justice referred to the “demonstrated efficacy of training institutes.” In order to better understand the long-range potential
of the institutes and their impact on the progress of the Faith,
344

51.6

51.7

it may be worthwhile to consider the elements that characterize
an effective training institute. What administrative structures
have served well in implementing institute programs? What
level of collaboration between the institutions of the Faith has
helped to foster the institute process? Are there any principles
of curriculum development that have been learned? Has any
type of delivery system proved especially effective? To answer
these questions, and others, we offer the experience of national
communities around the world that have, under the guidance
of the House of Justice, moved the development of training
institutes forward with extraordinary rapidity and impressive
results.
The document “Training Institutes,” released by the
House of Justice at the 1998 International Bahá’í Convention,
described the variations in national communities and how
the training institute might emerge differently according to
the characteristics of different countries and the nature and
size of their Bahá’í communities. However, the most striking
observation that can be made when surveying the growth of
training institutes around the world during the past two years
is that there are important parallels among the most successful
programs and there is a convergence of thought and practice
about the development of training institutes that has emerged
from implementation of the careful guidance given by the
House of Justice to this worldwide enterprise.

51.7

1.1 Administrative structure
51.8

51.9

In most countries of the world the basic administrative
structure for the training institutes has been to establish a
national institute with an institute board. In a few national
communities that have large Bahá’í populations or that cover
large geographical areas, and generally where Regional Bahá’í
Councils exist, regional institutes have been established with
their own boards. In the majority of these cases, National
Spiritual Assemblies have decided that the institute boards
report to the Regional Councils, while the National Assemblies
themselves set broad policy and guide the overall development
of the institute process.
In all parts of the world the boards of training institutes
have taken up their responsibilities with vigor, carrying out their
tasks either under the supervision of the National Assembly
or the appropriate Regional Council. They seem to have
345

51.8

51.9

Turning Point

understood well the nature of their functions. Individuals who
are appointed to the institute boards should have a readiness
to learn about the challenges and promise of human resource
development, be aware of the need to focus on training, and
be able to work effectively in a small team. The collaboration
of both arms of the Administrative Order in the appointment
process has proved essential.
51.10

If a board of directors is named, its membership should
be decided upon by the National Spiritual Assembly in
consultation with the Counsellors and with their full
support. . . .2

51.10

51.11

As Counsellors, National Assemblies, and the institute
boards consider how to present courses to a growing number
of believers, questions about the necessary administrative
structures generally arise. The House of Justice has cautioned
against an elaborate system of regional branches, which can be
costly and generally still require believers to come to a central
location:

51.11

51.12

. . . at this stage in your efforts to raise up human resources
it is not necessary to establish regional branches, which
generally involve high costs, including maintenance of
facilities, equipment, and expenses for participants, such as
transportation, food and housing.3

51.12

51.13

Rather than regional branches, an effective structure has been
to appoint regional coordinators who oversee the extension
of the institute courses to local communities within a region.
As the number of study circles in an area increases, regional
coordinators are needed to encourage and support the efforts
of the tutors, to promote the further multiplication of study
circles, and to coordinate the work of the institute with institutions in the area.
In some national communities there had been a proliferation of activities referred to as “institutes.” It was necessary to
clarify that these local initiatives, largely focused on deepening,
while praiseworthy, were not “institutes” as called for by the
House of Justice. In this connection, it is important to draw a
distinction between such initiatives and the extension of institute courses to the local level as part of a national or regional
program to provide training to ever-larger numbers of believers.
The House of Justice explains:

51.13

51.14

346

51.14

Additional Documents
51.15

As the friends gain a clearer understanding of the intent
of the House of Justice in calling for the establishment of
institutes, these local efforts will gradually become associated, as branches or study groups, with a regional institute
serving a much larger population. In this context, what
defines a region will necessarily vary. . . . Regardless, with
the strengthening of regional institutes, the concept of a
training institute will become more and more separated in
the minds of the friends from that of a local deepening class
or a teaching group.4

51.15

1.2 Collaboration
51.16

51.17

In its Rid.ván 153 [1996] message and other letters, the
House of Justice called for close collaboration between the two
arms of the Administration in the development of institutes. In
analyzing the growth and progress of training institutes during
the Four Year Plan, one of the most compelling conclusions has
been the importance of consultation between the Counsellors
and National Assemblies about the direction and operation of
the training institutes. To the degree to which close collaboration was achieved, there was a corresponding likelihood that
the training institute process would be firmly grounded in the
guidance of the House of Justice and would experience success
in creating a body of confirmed and active supporters of the
Faith.
In a national community there must exist a common vision
between the Counsellors and the National Spiritual Assembly
about the character and direction of the institute process. This
has been achieved where there has been “intimate involvement in institute operations” by the Counsellors and their
auxiliaries. Furthermore, the collaboration of Counsellors with
those Regional Bahá’í Councils that have responsibility for
administering regional training institutes, and of Counsellors
and Auxiliary Board members with training institute boards,
has provided the opportunity for this arm of the Administration
to further its sacred purpose of diffusing the Divine Fragrances
and promoting learning. As explained in the Rid.ván 153 [1996]
message, the character of institutes “harmonizes with, and provides scope for the exercise of, the educational responsibilities
of the Auxiliary Board members.”5

347

51.16

51.17

Turning Point
51.18

The House of Justice has emphasized in several instances
the necessity of the ongoing collaboration between the two
arms of the Administration:

51.18

51.19

This matter calls for an intensification of the collaboration between the Continental Counsellors and National
Spiritual Assemblies. For the success of these training
institutes will depend in very large measure on the active involvement of the Continental Counsellors and the
Auxiliary Board members in their operation. Particularly
will it be necessary for Auxiliary Board members to have a
close working relationship with institutes. . . .6

51.19

51.20

A process of decision-making must be arrived at, in consultation between you and the Counsellors, regarding the
preparation and approval of the annual plans and budgets
for the institutes. This would involve in each case, of
course, close interaction between the Counsellors and the
institutes or institute boards. . . .7

51.20

51.21

In the functioning of the training institute boards we
have witnessed the close cooperation of the two arms of the
Administration, particularly the participation of Auxiliary
Board members, fulfilling the House of Justice’s expectation
that the “intimate involvement in institute operations should
now become a part of the evolving functions of these officers
of the Faith.”8

51.21

51.22

From these guidelines, you can see that it is entirely
acceptable for Auxiliary Board members to be appointed by
the National Assembly in agreement with the Counsellors
to the board of an institute. Of course, their participation in
the institute work is not limited to membership on boards
of directors. As mentioned in your letter, many will also
serve as coordinators and act as teachers. Whether they
take up these responsibilities on a full-time basis is a matter
for them to decide in consultation with the Counsellors
concerned.9

51.22

51.23

In most countries Auxiliary Board members are serving on
institute boards. However, it is in those places where the guidance of the House of Justice on the critical role of the Board
members in the development of the institute process has been
fully implemented that one can observe the greatest progress.

51.23

348

Additional Documents
51.24

In countries where Regional Bahá’í Councils exist, close
interaction between the Councils and the training institutes is
vitally important and can create “a galvanic coherence of the
processes effecting expansion and consolidation in a region,”
and “the practical matching of the training services of institutes
to the developmental needs of local communities.”10

51.24

1.3 Curriculum
51.25

At the heart of the training institute is the curriculum selected by the institute board, in consultation with the National
Spiritual Assembly and the Counsellors.

51.25

51.26

In view of the experience gained thus far, you are urged to
outline, in consultation with Counsellors and the boards,
a sequence of a few courses designed to endow the friends
in your community with the spiritual insights, knowledge
and skills needed to serve the Faith with increasing
effectiveness.11

51.26

51.27

Since any curriculum is a vehicle for achieving educational
goals, the most effective curriculum for institutes has proved to
be one that truly trains the believers for service in the fields of
expansion and consolidation. Early on in the Four Year Plan
it became apparent in many countries that although deepening
was essential and must continue, the in-depth study of a book
or specialized subject in the institutes would not necessarily
result in mobilizing large numbers of Bahá’ís to become active
teachers. There are, of course, many important subjects in
which believers need to deepen, but the House of Justice in
several letters has discouraged training institutes from incorporating specialized topics into their programs at the expense of a
focus on a basic sequence of courses.

51.27

51.28

The House of Justice has reservations, however, on
the desirability of involving the Training Institutes in this
program. The Training Institutes should be developing and
applying a coherent, systematic program for increasing the
human resources of the Bahá’í community. Naturally, as
part of such a curriculum there will be place for including
reference to the law of H
. uqúqu’lláh and the whole matter of supporting the funds of the Faith as a part of the
individual life of the believer and an essential element of
Bahá’í community life. However, to involve the Training
Institutes in a specific project of educating the members of

51.28

349

Turning Point

51.29

the community in the law of H
. uqúqu’lláh, or in preparing
training materials, would seem to be a diversion of their
main task.12
In designing the program for the education of the
members of the Bahá’í community in the Teachings, and
in selecting the curricula of summer schools and similar
occasions, a National Spiritual Assembly should include
all aspects of life, including the choosing of a spouse, but
the House of Justice feels that it is important for this to be
done in context. It is not felt, however, that this specialized subject is one which would be suitable for training
institutes, which have their own clearly defined purpose.13

51.29

1.3.1 A systematic approach
51.30

The April 1998 document on training institutes indicates
that it is a complex task to design curriculum materials that
combine the acquisition of knowledge and skills with the cultivation of inner qualities in a sequence that gradually prepares
believers for higher and higher levels of service. For this reason
national communities were encouraged to utilize materials
already prepared in other parts of the world that employed a
systematic approach and were designed to empower believers
to arise and serve.

51.30

51.31

The House of Justice is greatly encouraged by the proposed plan of activities of your institute and is particularly
pleased to note that it is concentrating on the execution of
its program, which draws upon readily available materials,
and has not allowed its energies to be consumed in planning
and design.14

51.31

51.32

As part of its mandate to assess institute curricula that
are available in the Bahá’í world, the International Teaching
Centre has found the Ruhi Institute materials to be particularly
appropriate. Many national communities are using the Ruhi
Institute curriculum either as the focus of their training institute
or as one of its tracks of study.
The Ruhi Institute curriculum had been tested and adapted
over many years. It has enabled the friends in different countries to get the institute system up and running in a short time.
Rather than having the participants be passive listeners to a
wide array of unconnected talks, the Ruhi Institute materials
seek to engage the friends fully in the process of learning.

51.32

51.33

350

51.33

Additional Documents

51.34

Bahá’ís with diverse cultural and educational backgrounds
have found the curriculum’s deceptively simple approach, based
heavily on connecting the believers to the Creative Word, both
appealing and empowering.
Even in those countries where the Ruhi Institute materials
have been chosen as the main curriculum or as one of the institute tracks, modifications and adaptations for local conditions
have occasionally been made. In a few countries a beginning
course has been developed for new believers which precedes
Book 1. In some areas the Ruhi Institute books have been supplemented with other materials to suit the local requirements.
Over time, through systematic educational experience, other
sequential curricula will be developed in various parts of the
world that display the same coherence that the Ruhi Institute
materials have achieved but are derived from the experience of
different national communities.

51.34

1.3.2 Sequence of courses
51.35

The Universal House of Justice has stressed the importance
of a sequence of courses in preparing the friends for the expansion and consolidation work:

51.35

51.36

. . . it may be timely for you to consider introducing another
component into your institute program. Unlike the courses
designed for deepening the generality of the believers, this
component would be concerned with helping a certain percentage of the friends, especially young people with some
formal education, enhance their capacity to perform the
tasks associated with an accelerated process of expansion
and consolidation. It would entail choosing a sequence of
courses which, building on one another, gradually endow
the students with the knowledge, skills and qualities needed
to serve the Faith with increasing effectiveness.15

51.36

51.37

Great strides have been made in involving the friends in
training institute courses, but more attention needs to be given
to ensure that they systematically proceed through a sequence
of courses.

51.37

51.38

Once the sequence has been selected, a steadily increasing
number of believers are recruited to enter the first basic
course, and relatively significant percentages are then helped

51.38

351

Turning Point

to reach higher and higher courses, enhancing thereby their
capacity for service.16
51.39

51.40

In countries with small Bahá’í populations a large number
of the friends have taken not only one course but completed
successive courses in a sequence. However, experience has
shown that in countries with large Bahá’í populations, most
participants study only the first level course. In a community
like India, where about 34,000 believers have completed level
one, this is undoubtedly a great achievement. Nevertheless, as
the number of those entering the institute program steadily
increases, so too should the percentage of believers who go on
to study the subsequent courses in the sequence. In this way,
the development of human resources is characterized by the
image of an ever-expanding pyramid. The size of the “pyramid”
is an indication of a national community’s success in creating
human resources to meet its needs for the tasks of expansion
and consolidation.
In countries where the human resources are growing, other
tracks of study, in addition to the basic sequence of courses,
have been introduced. These tracks may focus on such areas as
children’s education, literacy training, or health.

51.39

51.40

1.4 Delivery systems
51.41

Worldwide, the Bahá’ís have experimented with different
types of delivery systems in order to extend the reach of their
national or regional training institutes. In addition to courses
in central locations, several distance education delivery systems
have been successfully implemented in a number of countries.
These include extension courses, where the program of the
national institute is held in an area that can draw on Bahá’ís
from a cluster of villages or towns; institute campaigns, where
an intensive series of classes is given at the local level over a
period of a few weeks; and study circles, where a small group of
believers come together on a regular basis in their own locality
with a trained tutor who helps them to progress through a
selected sequence of courses.

51.41

1.4.1 Distance education
51.42

During the first two years of the Four Year Plan, in the
early stages in the establishment of many institutes, groups
of believers were brought to one central facility, either in the
352

51.42

Additional Documents
capital or in a regional center, for a week or a few weekends
to attend training courses and then returned to their home
communities. It became apparent, however, that the number
of believers who would be able to obtain training with this
approach soon reaches a limit. Whether because of the sheer
numbers of friends that must pass through the training or
because of the cost and inconvenience of traveling and staying
in a residential program, distance education has proved to be an
effective delivery system. In many instances the House of Justice
has stressed the value of this decentralized approach:
51.43

What can expand the institute’s coverage is for a sequence
of a few well-conceived courses to be selected and a band of
tutors trained, who then offer the courses at the local level
throughout the region to groups of eager believers. In this
way, the number of those studying in the institute program
at various levels steadily increases.17

51.43

51.44

A decentralized approach to the delivery of courses does
not transfer responsibility for training to the local institutions
but is a system adopted by the national or regional institute
to extend its program to the grassroots. In several cases, the
House of Justice has clarified the intent of decentralization as
described in the April 1998 document “Training Institutes”:

51.44

51.45

The solution does not seem to be the establishment of local
institutes, independent of the national institute. . . . these
run the danger of turning into deepening classes. This is not
to say that every local community should not continue to
conduct regular deepening programs. But, as far as human
resource development is concerned, the methodology that
seems to be most effective in reaching believers at the local
level is the formation of study circles which are coordinated
by a national institute or one of its branches.18

51.45

1.4.2 Study circles
51.46

Of the three above-mentioned delivery systems, the most
widely practiced on all continents is the study circle, sometimes
called a study group, a circle of study, or a circle of learning.
The House of Justice has encouraged this flexible, low cost
form of distance education:

51.46

51.47

Initially, such courses might need to be offered at the institute sites, but, as a growing number of tutors are trained,

51.47

353

Turning Point

study circles could eventually be formed throughout the
country. Such a system of distance-education seems particularly well suited to the geographical makeup of Papua
New Guinea.19
51.48

. . . the system of delivery of courses through study circles, a
system which we understand the national institute of Bolivia
is attempting to gradually establish throughout the country,
is designed to bring the institute courses to the level of each
locality. In this case, a sequence of courses is offered to small
groups of believers in villages and towns by tutors trained by
the institute itself or a branch operating in the region. Efforts
to put into place such a vast system can only flourish in an
environment characterized by a spirit of unity and collaboration among all the institutions of the Faith.20

51.48

51.49

A distinguishing feature of study circles is that in many
countries, and across diverse cultures, they have created a new
dynamic within the community and have become nuclei of community life and catalysts for teaching, service, and community
development. In addition to study of the institute courses, the
members of the study circle, both Bahá’ís and non-Bahá’ís,
often participate in service and extracurricular activities that
bind the group together in fellowship and attract others to
this mode of learning. Having experienced the participatory
learning style of the courses, the members of the study circle
gradually take on a stronger commitment to actively serve and
apply the knowledge and skills they are gaining to the work of
the Faith. Some members of study circles are eventually trained
as tutors and then initiate their own study circles.
After studying one course, many of the members of a
study circle will stay together to go on to the next course, but
some may drop out until they are ready and able to pursue a
subsequent course. As friends move on to higher level courses,
and other friends join at various points in the sequence, the
membership of a study circle can gradually change. Although
members of study circles will often engage in social and service
activities together, no feelings of exclusivity should be allowed
to develop among them. Furthermore, the study circles should
be guided by the spirit of consultation in planning recreation,
teaching, and service activities.
Since a key purpose of the study circle is to raise human
resources that are to be utilized in the community, the Local

51.49

51.50

51.51

354

51.50

51.51

Additional Documents
Spiritual Assemblies, the area teaching committees, and the
Auxiliary Board members will need to know where they are located and draw on their members for the tasks of teaching and
consolidation. Several letters written on behalf of the House of
Justice address the importance of collaboration in supporting
the friends in their teaching endeavors:
51.52

. . . in a locality where the Local Spiritual Assembly is functioning, it would collaborate with the national institute or
its branch in supporting the work of the study circles, while
pursuing its own plans for the expansion and consolidation
of the Cause.21

51.52

51.53

Personal teaching requires stimulation from the institutions;
it must be fostered by National and Local Spiritual Assemblies,
on the one hand, and the Counsellors and their auxiliaries, on
the other. The institutions should also nurture and support
the members of study circles and other individuals in the community in acts of service that come about through personal
initiative.

51.53

1.4.3 Tutors and tutor training
51.54

51.55

The experience of the past few years has shown that the
selection and training of tutors are crucial for the extension
of the institute process to the grassroots and for the success of
the study circles. In many parts of the world this realization
has led to a focus on raising up an ever-growing number of
tutors, either from among the participants in the study circles
or, initially, from experienced believers who take part in events
that combine institute courses with tutor training.
Since the effectiveness of the tutors is critical to the success
of the institute process, more and more attention has been given
to the content of the training, the skills needed to organize
a study circle and lead the participants through the courses,
and the attitudes necessary both to nurture the participants in
their learning and maintain the cohesion of the group. Tutors
require training in how to keep the participants focused on the
material, how to formulate questions that stimulate reflection,
and how to foster active participation within the group. They
need to combine the qualities of love, humility, and patience,
with the dedication, perseverance, and commitment required to
create a spiritual atmosphere conducive to learning. It should
be emphasized that tutor training is not a one-time event but
355

51.54

51.55

Turning Point

51.56

an ongoing activity where tutors come together periodically to
share experiences and ideas. In many countries educated youth
have proved to be an excellent source for institute tutors.
Regional coordinators, who often come from the ranks of
tutors, will need these same abilities, plus some administrative
capacity to maintain records, track the progress of the study
circles, organize training programs, supervise tutors, and
coordinate the work of the institute with the activities of the
institutions in the area.

51.56

2. Institutes in Action
2.1 Creating human resources
51.57

As believers in each country advance through a sequence of
courses and their skills and abilities are enhanced, the responsibility then falls on the institutions of the Faith to see that the
energies, talents, and newly acquired skills of these friends are
channeled in some form of active service to the Cause. In this
regard, the House of Justice has pointed out:

51.57

51.58

Ample opportunities should be given to them to put into
practice what they have learned, and in this connection, you
will need to create within your community an encouraging
environment, one in which the friends feel empowered to
step forward, whatever their capacities may be, and take up
the work of the Faith.22

51.58

51.59

One of the most exciting aspects of a review of the accomplishments of the Four Year Plan has been to survey the
development of the training institutes worldwide and to take
note of the successes national communities have reported in advancing the process of entry by troops. Each continent has had
its own challenges and record of achievements in the growth of
training institutes. Overall, however, a pattern of the institute
process has emerged that is not confined to one country or part
of the world but represents a common direction for the Bahá’í
world in its development of human resources.
Previously Africa had several years of experience with institutes, but a shift had to be made from offering deepening courses
to establishing training programs. In order to implement this
new orientation, a focus was placed on tutor training and the
translation of institute materials into French and Portuguese,
as well as many local languages. Training institutes in several

51.59

51.60

356

51.60

Additional Documents

51.61

51.62

national communities in Africa have made significant advances,
extending the reach of the institute process throughout each
country while also initiating social and economic development
activities. The Uganda Bahá’í Institute for Development has an
impressive delivery system of courses; more than 1,500 friends
have completed a level one course and 35 percent of them have
gone through higher level courses. In Zambia the training
institute has had similar success. Nearly 1,000 individuals have
completed the first course and one-third of these participants
have completed higher courses in the sequence. Both Uganda
and Zambia have systematically trained tutors—185 and 144
respectively—in order to support their delivery systems.
The Americas have witnessed a tremendous acceleration
in the creation of human resources. There are more than
500 study circles in Latin America, and nearly 1,000 tutors
have been trained. In Brazil alone the development of human
resources has been impressive: there are 568 tutors and 260
study circles, with more than 5,000 believers participating in
the institute process of which some 400 are junior youth. The
Ruhi Institute, located in Colombia, has provided training to
more than 40 members of National Assemblies and institute
boards and has prepared a group of 16 resource persons who
can advise institutes in different countries about their programs.
In the United States, training in the methodology of the Core
Curriculum, one of the tracks of the institutes in that country,
has been provided to Bahá’ís from more than 52 countries.
In all 39 countries of Asia that have National Assemblies,
training institutes have been established and have recorded the
highest levels of participation, in terms of absolute numbers
as well as percentages. Approximately 60,000 friends have
attended at least one training institute course, and of those,
some 34,000 were in India. Nepal has shown a high degree
of participation with approximately 20 percent of the Bahá’ís
having completed the level one course. In Russia and the other
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States a large
percentage of the national communities have attended at least
one institute course—for example, 60 percent of the Bahá’ís
in Armenia and 35 percent of the friends in Kazakhstan. In
the Arabian countries, partly because of the small size of their
communities, the percentages rise even higher—76 percent in
Bahrain, 43 percent in Kuwait, and 36 percent in Oman.

51.62

Turning Point
51.63

51.64

51.65

This widespread involvement of the believers in the institutes
is reflected in the achievements the national communities have
made in the translation of curriculum into local languages—
14 in India, 10 in Southeast Asia, and 5 in Central Asia. Most of
the institutes in Asia, as in Africa, have also developed distinct
tracks in their institutes so that in addition to a basic sequence,
there are programs for literacy training, moral classes, and in
some cases “higher learning” courses.
Like the institutes in Africa, those in Australasia are focusing
their energies increasingly on the offering of training ­programs,
rather than deepening courses alone. Outside resource persons
are being utilized to train English- and French-speaking tutors
for Australia, New Zealand, and 10 Pacific islands. A sequence
of courses and study circles have been established in several
states of Australia and on the major islands of Hawaii. In
Papua New Guinea the institute organized an efficient network
for delivering courses, mostly deepening in nature, to nearly
two-thirds of the believers. Now the institute is focusing on
delivering a sequence of courses that will train a percentage of
these friends in the tasks of expansion and consolidation.
Europe refocused its training institutes on a sequence of
courses and a decentralized delivery system. From the Baltics to
the Balkans a host of 125 tutors has been trained and continentwide resource persons are also being identified to assist national
communities with training institutes. Over a nine-month period
12 regional tutor training seminars were held in England,
France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Albania,
Romania, and Belarus. Out of this effort scores of study circles
have been launched in country after country.

2.2 Impact on teaching and growth
51.66

51.67

Although there is always a range of factors that contribute
to growth in a community, reports of achievements in the teaching field from Counsellors and National Assemblies indicate
that these developments are increasingly influenced, either
directly or indirectly, by the institute process.
In Bangladesh, where the training institute process is well
established, over 11,000 believers entered the Faith in the third
year of the Four Year Plan. A survey carried out by members
of the institutions in that country determined that nearly 8,000
of these enrollments were the result of individual teaching
by institute participants, particularly the tutors. In South
358

51.66

51.67

Additional Documents

51.68

51.69

51.70

Africa, it has been reported that between the first two years
of the Four Year Plan and the third year of the Plan, when the
institute process was well under way, there was an increase of
40 percent in the number of new enrollments. The National
Spiritual Assembly has concluded that this level of growth is
due primarily to individual initiative stimulated by the training
institute courses.
Local teaching projects and teaching campaigns have been
taken up with increasing vigor and have provided a major
avenue of service for institute participants. In addition to the 30
percent increase since 1998 in the number of teaching projects
funded by the Teaching Centre, news of several hundred locally
initiated projects, many of them self-supporting, demonstrated
the upswing in the tempo of teaching in different parts of the
world.
Reports also suggest that there has been a marked increase
in the number of firesides around the world, an indication of
the level of teaching undertaken at the initiative of the individual. In Ireland a national program entitled “Core Project,”
whose goal is to establish 20 firesides, has been operating in
conjunction with a series of training institute courses. A similar
trend has been noted in Slovakia, which launched a national
fireside campaign during the last year of the Four Year Plan. In
the southern region of the United States individual initiative has
manifested itself in a growing number of firesides, particularly
by institute participants. There has also been a notable rise in
the number of firesides across the southern part of Australia in
Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia, as well as
in some island communities of the Pacific, such as Tonga, where
over 660 souls have entered the Faith in the last three years.
The National Spiritual Assembly of Japan has far exceeded its
fireside goal for the Four Year Plan.
Parallel to this, and contributing to the overall spiritual
atmosphere needed for teaching and growth, is the dramatic
increase in the number of devotional meetings worldwide.
The April 1998 document on training institutes mentions the
establishment of devotional meetings as one of the first acts of
service that those who have completed institute courses can
carry out. Such meetings have been initiated in several countries
of Asia, where hundreds exist in India alone, and in many
countries of Latin America.

2.3 Direct instruments of teaching
51.71

In the same document on training institutes it was suggested
that Bahá’í communities that are small in size but have a large
percentage of knowledgeable believers consider having their institutes open courses to non-Bahá’ís. A number of enrollments
directly resulting from institute courses have been reported in
countries such as France, Greece, Korea, and Nepal, as well as
in countries with larger Bahá’í populations such as Ethiopia,
Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States. In addition, the Baltic
States, Belarus, Finland, and the Ukraine are opening some of
their courses to non-Bahá’ís. Countries that have experienced
large-scale expansion, such as India, Bangladesh, and the
Philippines, are also benefiting from this approach to teaching.
These countries have found that the majority of non-Bahá’ís
who participate in the institute programs accept the Faith by
the completion of the first course.

51.71

3. Systematization of Teaching
   (Area Growth Programs)
51.72

In order to realize the potential for growth that the training
of human resources has brought about, attention must be given
to the systematization of teaching efforts. In its message to the
Bahá’ís of the world announcing the Twelve Month Plan and
the Five Year Plan, the House of Justice presented this challenge
to communities:

51.72

51.73

It is essential that, during the one-year effort, national
and regional institutes everywhere bring into full operation
the programs and systems that they have now devised.
National communities should enter the Five Year Plan confident that the acquisition of knowledge, qualities and skills
of service by large contingents of believers, with the aid
of a sequence of courses, will proceed unhindered. Ample
attention must also be given to further systematization of
teaching efforts, whether undertaken by the individual or
directed by the institutions.23

51.73

51.74

With the further systematization of teaching efforts in mind,
the International Teaching Centre has identified certain patterns
of expansion and consolidation that lead to a process of accelerated and sustained growth. This approach to systematized
teaching is being developed in the context of an “Area Growth

51.74

360

Additional Documents

51.75

51.76

Program,” which focuses on a relatively small geographical
area with a manageable number of localities. At the heart of the
Area Growth Program is a systematic institute process under
the direction of the national or regional institute. As a growing
number of believers pass through the courses of the training institute, the pool of human resources for various expansion and
consolidation undertakings increases. Auxiliary Board members
and their assistants will encourage these believers to utilize their
newly acquired capabilities in teaching the Faith and in acts of
service, such as holding devotional meetings, deepening one’s
fellow believers, and conducting children’s classes. Grassroots
involvement, where the local believers consult together, take action, and support one another in individual or group activities,
is a fundamental characteristic of an Area Growth Program.
Institute participants, as well as other local believers, will
take part in area-wide seminars and conferences, regional
teaching campaigns, and small socio-economic development
projects. Gradually, local collective endeavors will emerge, area
committees and Local Spiritual Assemblies will formulate their
own plans for expansion and consolidation, and the friends will
begin to shoulder the responsibilities of systematic growth in
their communities.
The process of learning about growth that was launched
with the Four Year Plan has confirmed the vision the House of
Justice gave in its Rid. ván message of 153 [1996] that advancing the process of entry by troops depends on raising up large
numbers of trained believers. As increasing numbers of Bahá’ís
go through the institute courses and, in so doing, develop a
stronger Bahá’í identity and desire to serve, a dynamic for
growth is created in our communities. Even if only a fraction of
the participants become active teachers, having more and more
Bahá’ís proceed through a sequence of courses generates a spirit
that motivates the believers and revitalizes the community. For
this reason the strategy of the Area Growth Programs is to
have the teaching and expansion work revolve around the
institutes.

51.75

51.76

4. Challenges for Training Institutes
51.77

The extraordinary growth of institutes around the world
has brought with it a number of challenges. Some of these are
general issues that many communities face while others are
361

51.77

Turning Point

specific to continents or individual countries. A general priority is for national communities to reflect on the achievements
of their institutes, to assess the efficacy of their approaches,
and to modify certain elements in light of experience or new
circumstances. This analysis and reflection should take place
periodically between National Assemblies and Counsellors and
by institute boards, Auxiliary Board members, and Regional
Councils where applicable.
4.1 Quality and effectiveness
51.78

During the Four Year Plan, most national communities
worked on the establishment and initial functioning of the
institute process. At the start, a focus on generating institutional capacity to deliver a few basic courses generally took
precedence over a concern with program quality. Gradually,
increasing attention is being given to the challenge of striking
a balance between quantity and quality. While it remains a
priority to think in terms of reaching large numbers of friends
with the institute program, attention at the same time must be
given to improving its overall effectiveness. As institutes strive
to upgrade the quality of training and the delivery of courses,
they will come closer to fulfilling the aim of raising up “large
numbers of believers who are trained to foster and facilitate the
process of entry by troops with efficiency and love.”24

51.78

4.2 Illiteracy
51.79

A great number of countries suffer from low literacy rates.
In some populations or areas, the rate is so low as to pose a
challenge to the institute process. The House of Justice has
stressed that institutes need not be held back at the outset
because of this concern.

51.79

51.80

It should be remembered that not every believer in Tanzania
will necessarily participate in your institute program.
Rather, a certain percentage of the friends will need to
receive training in order to enhance their capacity to carry
out the tasks of expansion and consolidation, including the
teaching and deepening of the generality of the believers. At
this early stage in the establishment of the institute, then,
the question of illiteracy should not be a central concern.
The immediate challenge before you is to help a large
number of the many capable members of your community,

51.80

362

Additional Documents
especially young people with some formal education, progress through a sequence of a few basic courses. Once this
has been accomplished, it may be possible for the institute
to expand its program to include a second track of courses
for the development of human resources in the area of
social and economic development, including literacy.25
51.81

Although the present institute courses are geared to
believers with basic education, efforts to address problems of
illiteracy can be given more attention as the institute develops,
possibly through offering a literacy course in a track for social
and economic development. This would ensure that there will
continue to be a ready population to undergo training and also
guarantee that certain groups with a high degree of illiteracy,
such as women, are not left behind in the process of developing
human resources.

51.81

4.3 Resource persons
51.82

Institute resource persons are Bahá’ís who have had
substantial training and national level experience in the
development of training institutes. The last two years of the
Four Year Plan witnessed a greater appreciation by the institutions of the Faith of the use of resource persons. Deployed at
the discretion of the Continental Boards of Counsellors, they
have played a significant and beneficial role in consulting with
national and regional institutions about the institute process
and in the training of coordinators and tutors. Excellent results
have been achieved from such training programs on all five
continents. The Teaching Centre would like to see a core of
such individuals on every continent, available to assist institutions with clarifying concepts, training tutors, and enhancing
the capacity of institutes. These outside consultants, however,
are no substitute for the process of evaluation and reflection
that National Assemblies, together with the Counsellors, must
undertake and sustain in order for the training institutes to
become fully indigenous and institutionalized.

51.82

4.4 Infrastructure
51.83

In the initial stages in the growth of an institute there has
not been an emphasis on acquiring buildings for the program.
In this respect the House of Justice has indicated:

363

51.83

Turning Point
51.84

With regard to the permanent training institute, you
will need office space to maintain the files and administration of this organization, but the institute courses will
need to reach a widely spread Bahá’í population. Access
to physical facilities for institute courses will of course be
necessary, but should probably not require the acquisition
of permanent institute buildings. . . . The House of Justice
is concerned that matters related to the acquisition and
maintenance of a new institute building . . . would require
resources which would be better used for the development
of the institute program itself.26

51.84

51.85

During the past four years similar advice from the House
of Justice has also been given to national communities with
extensive institute programs. However, as the 26 December
1995 message to the Conference of the Continental Boards
of Counsellors indicated, the institute, “at some stage of its
development, may require a building of its own.”27 No doubt
the question of infrastructure will soon need to be considered
carefully, particularly in countries where large numbers of
friends are moving through a sequence of courses.
The question of infrastructure is related not only to buildings but also to arrangements needed to maintain records and
statistics, to stay in contact with students, and to put in place
an efficient tracking system. The House of Justice has commented on such developments:

51.85

51.86

51.87

It now wishes us to commend you on the steps you have
taken to create a Desk at your National Office dedicated
to the systematization and dissemination of information
on human resource development. Keeping the community
informed of the status of your institute program and the
accomplishments of those taking part in it will help you
considerably to maintain enthusiasm among the friends for
training. In this and many other ways, the Human Resource
Desk will undoubtedly be of great assistance to you.28

51.86

51.87

4.5 Deputization of institute staff
51.88

In addition to collaborating with National Assemblies on
the areas of budget, management, curriculum, and course delivery, Counsellors and Auxiliary Board members have been called
upon to arouse the commitment of the friends to promote the
teaching work through the deputization of institute staff, an
364

51.88

Additional Documents
opportunity introduced by the Universal House of Justice in
its Rid. ván 153 [1996] message. This new measure has given
the friends yet another avenue to fulfill Bahá’u’lláh’s injunction
to propagate the Faith of God and that “Whoso is unable, it
is his duty to appoint him who will, in his stead, proclaim this
Revelation. . . .” The House of Justice has explained how the
call for deputization falls within the framework of teaching and
depends on individual response:
51.89

With the creation of training institutes across the globe,
an added opportunity for a more direct involvement in
deputization presents itself to the individual; the House of
Justice trusts therefore that the friends can be helped to feel
some connection with the specific centers of teaching activity to which their offerings for deputization are sent.29

51.89

51.90

Although local, regional and national institutions are
informing the friends of the importance of their sacred teaching obligation and of the opportunities for deputization, the
Counsellors and Auxiliary Board members are in an advantageous position to reach individuals at the grassroots and
summon forth their interest and commitment to this worldwide
enterprise. The House of Justice has explained:

51.90

51.91

It is for this reason that the Continental Counsellors and
their auxiliaries have been called upon to play a distinctive
role in this matter as officers bearing a particular responsibility for propagation, for the Auxiliary Board members
and their assistants operate at the grassroots of the community and are able readily not only to stimulate individuals to
teach but also to urge them, if their material circumstances
allow, to respond to the need for deputization.30

51.91

51.92

It is up to the Counsellors and Board members to provide
the friends with detailed information about current needs for
deputization, including the level of support required by institute
teachers in various parts of the world.

51.92

51.93

***
In conclusion, it might be said that the “dynamic state
of transformation” referred to in the Rid. ván 156 [1999]
message aptly describes the impact of training institutes on
our communities during the Four Year Plan. The institute has
become central to the life of the community and is beginning
to generate human resources to a degree that was not imagined
365

51.93

Turning Point

51.94

at the outset of the Plan. Clearly it is the institute process
that is at the core of the coherent vision that is guiding us in
advancing the process of entry by troops. As the House of
Justice expressed in the same message: “Understanding of the
necessity for systematization in the development of human
resources is everywhere taking hold.”31 It is also understood
that the process upon which we have embarked through the
training institutes is a long-term one.
The learning that has taken place about the systematic
development of human resources will now be extended to the
process of learning about the systematization of teaching.
Through the implementation of Area Growth Programs around
the world a new body of experience will emerge that will inform
our approach to teaching and our strategies about growth for
the next two decades. These efforts at systematic and unabated
action represent the deep desire and commitment of every
Bahá’í “to fulfill the intentions of a Plan whose major aim is to
accelerate that process which will make it possible for growing
numbers of the world’s people to find the Object of their quest
and thus to build a united, peaceful and prosperous life.”32

Building Momentum
A Coherent Approach to Growth
1. A Vision of Growth
52.2

During the past two years the believers and institutions
worldwide have focused their efforts on implementing the fundamental strategy of the Five Year Plan for creating a culture
of growth, a strategy succinctly described in a message from the
Universal House of Justice:

52.2

52.3

The Five Year Plan . . . requires concentrated and
sustained attention to two essential movements. The first
is the steady flow of believers through the sequence of
courses offered by training institutes, for the purpose of
developing the human resources of the Cause. The second,
which receives its impetus from the first, is the movement of
geographic clusters from one stage of growth to the next.1

52.3

52.4

These two movements have been at the heart of the learning
experience of the Bahá’í world and are the focus of this analysis.
The first movement had its beginnings with the establishment
of a network of training institutes during the Four Year Plan.
The second got under way only in the Five Year Plan, when
national communities, in response to the guidance of the House
of Justice, began by mapping their territories into geographic
clusters.

52.4

52.5

. . . National Spiritual Assemblies proceeded with relative
ease to divide the territories under their jurisdiction into
areas consisting of adjacent localities, called clusters, using
criteria that were purely geographic and social and did not
relate to the strength of local Bahá’í communities.2

52.5

368

Additional Documents
52.6

In its Rid.ván 2002 message the House of Justice described
how the exercise of clustering and categorizing has given the
institutions and believers a vision of systematic growth: “Such
a mapping . . . makes it possible to realize a pattern of wellordered expansion and consolidation.”

52.6

1.1 Categorizing clusters
52.7

Acknowledging that in some cases cluster boundaries
would be only a “reasonable approximation,”3 which might
be modified through experience, National Spiritual Assemblies
categorized the clusters according to broad stages of the development of the Faith as outlined in the message of 9 January
2001 from the House of Justice. In this connection the House
of Justice has stressed the following point:

52.7

52.8

To assign a cluster to one or another category is not to make
a statement about status. Rather, it is a way of evaluating
its capacity for growth, in order that an approach compatible with its evolving development can be adopted.4

52.8

52.9

In order to systematically advance the growth process,
National Assemblies and Regional Bahá’í Councils sought to
establish criteria for determining when a cluster would move
from one category to the next. In some cases such criteria were
expressed in numerical goals, while in others a qualitative
description was adopted. Defining minimum criteria for each
category is a process that grows principally out of experience. In
its message of 17 January 2003 the House of Justice described
the importance of this task:

52.9

52.10

. . . the task of refining the criteria needed for valid
assessments is proving to be an ongoing challenge to
institutions. . . . Rigid criteria are obviously counterproductive, but a well-defined scheme to carry out evaluation is
essential.5

52.10

52.11

Wherever Regional Councils exist, they are generally in the
best position to determine the current categories of the clusters
within their jurisdiction; Auxiliary Board members and agencies at the cluster level can also provide indispensable input.
According to the House of Justice, “two criteria seem especially
important” in this evaluation:

52.11

52.12

. . . the strength of the human resources raised up by the
training institute for the expansion and consolidation of

52.12

369

Turning Point

the Faith in the cluster, and the ability of the institutions to
mobilize these resources in the field of service.6
52.13

What is essential is that the institutions periodically assess the progress that has been made so that the strategies
being applied in a cluster are “compatible with its evolving
­development.”7 When warranted, the classification of a cluster
is changed and new priorities are set.

52.13

1.2 Establishing priorities
52.14

In addition to classifying clusters according to their capacity for growth, national and regional institutions set priorities
as to which clusters would receive greater focus early in the
Plan. At times this involved opening a few virgin clusters
and advancing some weak ones, but generally, concentration
was on the well-developed clusters in a country. Once the
institutions came to understand the types of strategies needed
to advance each category of clusters, it became apparent that
it was advantageous to select a few promising clusters where
the conditions for accelerated growth were the most favorable
and then work toward establishing an intensive program of
growth. The following guidance in a letter written on behalf of
the House of Justice to a National Assembly reflects the advice
given in such instances:

52.14

52.15

An important challenge now before you is to ensure
that one or two clusters in Austria reach the level at which
intensive growth programs can be established. This will
involve, foremost, helping the institute in your country
develop to a more advanced stage, endowed with the capacity to accompany a significant percentage of individuals
up to the point in its sequence of courses where they can
be trained to act as tutors and multiply the number of
study circles in the clusters selected. Given the receptivity
displayed in the past by some of the minority groups in
Austria . . . you would clearly do well to choose at least one
cluster with a large representation of such a population.8

52.15

52.16

And to another National Assembly, the House of Justice
explained the need for focus on a few advanced areas of high
potential:

52.16

52.17

In consultation with the Councils and the Counsellors, you
have identified several small geographic areas in which the

52.17

370

Additional Documents
local communities are gaining strength through a strong
institute process. As the second year of the Plan fast approaches, the House of Justice hopes that, if it has not
already been done, two or three of these clusters will be
selected to receive special attention in the coming months
so that they will soon reach the point where it will be possible to consider launching an intensive program of growth
in each.9
1.3 Proceeding through a sequence of courses
52.18

In its 17 January message the House of Justice addresses
the effort in which the believers are currently and principally
engaged:

52.18

52.19

Focus in almost every country has now turned to
stimulating the movement of its priority clusters from their
current stage of growth to the next. What has become strikingly clear is that progress in this respect depends largely
on the efficacy of the parallel process aimed at helping an
ever-increasing number of friends to move through the
main sequence of courses offered by the institute serving
the area.10

52.19

52.20

The impetus given to the institute process in the past two
years and, in particular, to having the believers proceed through
a sequence of courses was felt on all continents. The number of
participants who have completed at least one institute course
in the basic sequence continues to rise, but the most significant
achievement is that a swelling stream of friends has proceeded
through higher level courses. For example, 18 months into the
Five Year Plan, more than 10,000 believers had completed
Ruhi Institute Book 6, accounting for an increase of over 500
percent since April 2001, and more than 8,000 had completed
Ruhi Institute Book 7, resulting in a dramatically enlarged pool
of trained tutors.
Gradually most national communities around the world
adopted for their basic sequence of courses the Ruhi Institute
curriculum, which had been developed over many years specifically in response to large-scale expansion. In light of the focus
and energy being devoted to furthering the institute process in
every national community, concerns were expressed by some
believers about the emphasis on training and the use of a
uniform curriculum. In such a wide-scale enterprise of taking

52.20

52.21

371

52.21

Turning Point

great numbers of friends through a set curriculum, it is to be
expected that some individuals might not find the materials
suited to their learning style. Responding to this circumstance,
the House of Justice made the following comment in a letter
written on its behalf to an individual believer:
52.22

. . . reports from countries of diverse backgrounds suggest that many national Bahá’í communities which have
adopted the books of the Ruhi Institute are finding them
highly effective. It is natural that any given educational
program would not appeal to everyone and that some
would not wish to participate. . . . Nevertheless, a choice
has been made by the institutions in your country to offer
certain courses to the believers in the context of their plans
to advance the process of entry by troops. The House of
Justice is happy to see from your letter that you respect this
decision and do not want to make your own evaluation of
the program a cause for disunity.11

52.22

52.23

In another letter written on behalf of the House of Justice, the
relationship of the individual believer to the institute process is
given further clarification:

52.23

52.24

To say that the institute is only useful for newly enrolled
believers and those who read little is not correct. Many
mature and deepened believers are participating in the institute process, both as students and as teachers of various
courses, in an effort to contribute directly to the promotion
of entry by troops in their respective countries. Through
such participation they have furthered their understanding
of the requisites of growth and of the action required to
maintain it, have caught fresh glimpses of spiritual truths,
and have developed their skills and abilities of service. Far
from interfering with their own study of the Writings, each
according to his or her own capacity and needs, their association with a training institute has enhanced the process.
Yet clearly such participation is not a requirement for every
Bahá’í, who, in the final analysis, can choose the manner
in which he or she will serve the Faith. What is essential is
that the institute process be supported even by those who
do not wish to take part in it.12

52.24

52.25

At the same time the House of Justice has explained that no
special designation should be accorded to those who are study-

52.25

372

Additional Documents
ing in the institute or serving as tutors, nor should the friends
feel any demarcation based on participation in the institute:
52.26

It is quite reasonable to expect that, as far as training
by the institute is concerned, certain courses would have
as their prerequisite the completion of other courses.
However, this notion should not be carried over into
other Bahá’í ­activities, and clearly no distinction should be
made between “trained” and “untrained” believers in the
country. That for certain types of service the qualifications
of the believers would need to be taken into account is
natural. Yet the way should be open for all the friends, irrespective of the degree of their knowledge and experience,
to participate in the affairs of the Faith. . . .13

52.26

52.27

Those communities that did not become absorbed with
issues of curriculum but turned their attention to putting a
system in place were able to learn more quickly how to deliver
their courses to large numbers of believers and to consolidate
the institute process. Nevertheless, by the outset of the Five
Year Plan the believers in most countries had not proceeded
beyond the first few courses of the institute. The challenge
for National Spiritual Assemblies of furthering the institute
process and maintaining a clear focus was aptly described in a
letter written on behalf of the House of Justice to a National
Assembly:

52.27

52.28

To help large numbers of believers go through a sequence
of courses is a formidable task, involving systematic work
with an increasing number of tutors, the establishment of
study circles, and measures for monitoring the progress of
the participants. The friends in charge of the process need
to have clarity of vision and should be allowed to carry out
their mission without distraction.14

52.28

1.4 “Evoking the spirit of enterprise”
52.29

During the Four Year Plan, guidance from the House of
Justice had stressed that as the believers completed higher
courses in the sequence, their capacity to serve the Cause would
be enhanced. In its message of 17 January this dynamic was
confirmed:

52.29

52.30

The rise in activity around the world testifies to the success
of these courses in evoking the spirit of enterprise required

52.30

373

Turning Point

to carry out the divers actions that growth in a cluster, at
whatever stage, demands.15
52.31

Nowhere was this “rise in activity” more evidenced than in
the increase in study circles and other core activities. According
to the data available at the Bahá’í World Centre, the number of
study circles worldwide increased from 3,600 in April 2001 to
almost 9,000 in October 2002. The participation of individuals
in devotional gatherings and children’s classes increased by 80
and 63 percent respectively in the same period, with the highest
percentage rise in both categories registered by countries in
Asia. For the most part this proliferation of community activities was the expression of individual initiative by believers who
translated into action what they had internalized from their
training institute courses.

52.31

2. Movement of Clusters from One
   Stage of Growth to the Next
2.1 Opening virgin areas
52.32

The newfound zeal and initiative of the believers have
been manifested at one level in the opening of virgin clusters.
Although in the first two years of the Five Year Plan most
countries have focused on advancing well-developed clusters
toward intensive programs of growth, whenever virgin areas
were opened to the Faith, a concentrated effort was made to lay
a solid foundation for systematic expansion. Cognizant of the
advice from the House of Justice of the value of pioneers being
“experienced in institute programs,”16 National Assemblies
encouraged homefront pioneers (short- and long-term) who
settled in unopened clusters to promote the institute process. In
general, study circles represented a principal means of teaching
in these areas, along with devotional gatherings and firesides,
as human resources began to emerge. This met with a warm
response from the House of Justice:

52.32

52.33

As we had hoped, goals for the opening of virgin clusters
are being readily met by enthusiastic participants of
institute programs who, equipped with the knowledge and
skills acquired through training courses, set out to establish
the Faith in a new area and bring a fledgling community
into being.17

52.33

374

Additional Documents
52.34

52.35

In Canada, the National Assembly announced the goal
of settling homefront pioneers in all of the country’s nine
unopened clusters by Rid.ván 2002. To this end the Assembly
organized two national institute campaigns of five weeks each
whereby a total of 39 believers completed the books in their
institute’s sequence. By Rid.ván 2002, six of the nine goal areas
had been filled, and five of the pioneers were trained tutors. As
of September 2002, all the homefront goals were achieved.
Foremost among the strategies for virgin clusters, therefore,
have been encouraging homefront pioneers to become trained
as tutors and implementing homefront pioneering projects that
emphasize the establishment of the institute process in these
areas. It has sometimes proved advantageous to identify goal
areas adjacent to well-developed clusters, as these are more
accessible to believers who can facilitate study circles. In fact,
with a growing number of tutors being trained in the well­developed clusters, homefront goals can increasingly be met
when such friends come forward to offer this kind of service.
Reports on pioneer movement during the first year of the Five
Year Plan indicate that about 725 believers arose to pioneer on
the home front, nearly half of them in the Americas.

2.2 Establishing the institute process in emerging clusters
52.36

52.37

52.38

Clusters at the next level of development, characterized in
the 9 January message as having “a few isolated localities and
groups,” often encompass a broad spectrum of Bahá’í activity,
depending on the country, the history of growth in the cluster,
and whether the area is rural or urban.
Two different conditions have predominated in this
category. There are a number of clusters that experienced largescale growth in the past but had no functioning Local Spiritual
Assemblies and very few active believers. Also prevalent are
clusters that had, in addition to isolated localities and groups,
functioning Local Assemblies, some with only basic capacity
and others with longstanding experience and active communities, but with minimal or no institute activity. The general
approach in both these types of clusters has been to strengthen
the institute process, but the means and pace have differed
according to their particular circumstances.
In clusters that have experienced large-scale expansion,
an approach that has proved effective is for a teaching team
to reestablish contact with responsive friends and gradually
375

52.36

52.37

52.38

Turning Point

introduce institute courses in the area. In recommending such
an approach to a National Assembly that faced the challenge of
having areas with great numbers of believers who had not been
contacted for years, the House of Justice explained:
52.39

In many countries of the world, meeting this challenge
requires that attention be concentrated on those localities
for which long lists of believers often exist, but which, with
the passage of time, have ceased to have any Bahá’í activity. In your case you would do well to establish a specific
program according to which teams of able teachers would
visit such communities one after another, spend time with
the believers they can locate, and teach receptive souls until
the conditions become favorable for the institute to enter
and offer its courses.18

52.39

52.40

In several national communities in Asia, believers who had completed their institutes’ second book in the sequence undertook
visits of this kind. In Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines,
this effort resulted in a number of believers’ joining institute
courses and devotional gatherings and becoming reactivated
after many years. In the letter cited above, the House of Justice
elaborated further on this approach:

52.40

52.41

. . . the purpose of such campaigns in local communities
which have been dormant for years would not be to find
every Bahá’í whose name appears on the membership list
and verify his or her status. The list of names should be
considered, rather, as a starting point, leading to opportunities to meet individuals who are willing to engage in
meaningful conversation, exploring spiritual realities and
learning more and more about the Faith.19

52.41

52.42

In clusters that had active communities but lacked a strong
presence of the institute, a first requirement has been for the institutions and believers in such areas to acquire a clear vision of
the pivotal role of the training institute in the implementation
of the Plan and to commit themselves to this priority. Once this
is grasped, these clusters can progress fairly rapidly to develop
the institute process.
In practical terms, advancing the institute process in this
category of clusters has meant increasing the number of tutors
and study circles so that more believers become involved in the
institute process. This objective can be achieved in a number

52.42

52.43

376

52.43

Additional Documents

52.44

52.45

of ways, depending on the level of human resources in the
­cluster—for example, by short-term homefront pioneers serving as tutors, by tutors from a nearby cluster facilitating study
circles, or by friends from these emerging clusters participating
in centralized training courses or extension courses in their
area.
As more study circles have been established in these clusters, a growing number of friends have become engaged in the
study of the first one or two books of the institute. However,
the House of Justice highlighted the value of putting in place a
system for taking believers through a full sequence of courses
and the potential impact of this arrangement:
The challenge is not simply to have a certain percentage
study one or two courses, but a sequence of several courses
through an effective system of distance education. And if
the institute succeeds in accomplishing this, there should be
a corresponding increase in the tempo of the teaching work
as more and more friends arise to serve the Faith. A steady
stream of newly enrolled believers will, in turn, enter the
institute’s program, and in this way the system as a whole
will be in a constant state of expansion.20

52.44

52.45

2.3 Advancing clusters with a vigorous institute process
52.46

In order “to ensure that one or two clusters . . . reach the
level at which intensive growth programs can be established,”21
a great deal of attention has been directed toward further
developing strong clusters and preparing them for intensive
growth. The principal means to advance these clusters have
been institute campaigns, reflection meetings, and a gradual
multiplication of core activities. This latter objective is most
easily fulfilled by inviting seekers to these activities. The experience of the institutions and believers in this category of clusters
has been substantial and instructive.

52.46

2.3.1 Institute Campaigns
52.47

Although the meaning of a “vigorous” institute process was
interpreted in a variety of ways, efforts to further the institute
process in the more well-developed clusters have involved taking
significant numbers of friends through the sequence of courses
and rapidly increasing the number of trained tutors. In some
instances this has been swiftly and effectively ­ accomplished
377

52.47

Turning Point

52.48

through institute campaigns, which have augmented ongoing
efforts to expand the number of study circles. In most instances
these campaigns have been designed to enable the believers who
have already completed the first few books in the sequence,
and preferably have served as tutors, to move in an accelerated
manner through the remaining books. This process has generated a great deal of enthusiasm and helped create a sizable
group of capable believers who have begun to understand “the
prerequisites for sustainable growth.”22
In Asiatic Russia an institute campaign in the first few
months of the Five Year Plan resulted in 76 believers completing all six books of the institute and becoming prepared to
act as tutors for any of the books in the sequence. Urban
clusters such as Perth, Australia; Minsk, Belarus; Vancouver,
Canada; Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; Karachi, Pakistan; and Los
Angeles, the United States; and well-developed rural or semiurban clusters in, for example, Cameroon, the Central African
Republic, Kenya, India, and Italy undertook such campaigns
and registered immediate gains in the number of study circles
in the clusters. The House of Justice commented on this type
of endeavor:

52.48

52.49

It is most encouraging to see that the progress of this
work [the internal development of the clusters] is being
energized through the training institute process, which was
considerably strengthened . . . by the campaigns undertaken in many countries to increase the number of trained
tutors.23

52.49

52.50

In areas with active, deepened believers, the progression of
individuals through the sequence of courses has moved quickly,
once the community members committed themselves to the
process. A good example of this dynamic is evidenced in the
experience of Western Australia. A concentrated focus in this
state on involving increasing numbers of friends in the institute,
aided by a series of campaigns, resulted in more than half of
its 1,500 believers participating in institute courses. In less
than three months the number of study circles, which included
seekers, doubled from 52 to 103 and as a consequence of this
“increase in the tempo of the teaching work,” 36 new believers
entered the Faith. This was three times the number of new
enrollments recorded for each of the previous two years.

52.50

378

Additional Documents
2.3.2 Multiplication of Core Activities
Movement of the cluster toward the next stage of development is directly associated with “the multiplication of study
circles, devotional meetings and children’s classes, and the
expansion they engender.”24 As the pool of trained human
resources grows, an increase in these and other activities occurs
naturally. As indicated, the attention given in the past two years
to training more tutors has had a measurable impact on the
number of study circles worldwide. Not only has this figure
now reached 10,000, but one-third of the participants are
studying the higher books in the institute’s sequence. Efforts to
bring new believers and seekers into the institute process have
created a fresh dynamic in clusters. As more and more new
declarants join institute courses, “the system as a whole will be
in a constant state of expansion.”25
The growing pool of human resources generated by the
institute process has made it possible to establish an increasing
number of two other core activities: devotional gatherings and
children’s classes.

52.51

52.53

Devotional meetings begin to flourish as consciousness of
the spiritual dimension of human existence is raised among
the believers in an area through institute courses.26

52.53

52.54

In various parts of the world, special endeavors to increase the
number of devotional meetings often begin with encouraging
believers inspired by their institute course on spiritual life to
undertake such meetings on their own. Another approach
that has resulted in an expansion in number previously not
contemplated has been to hold devotional gatherings in the
homes of non-Bahá’ís, who sometimes organize the meetings
themselves. Employing this arrangement over a six-month
period, the believers in Malaysia were able to increase tenfold
the devotional meetings in their advanced clusters and the level
of participation by 40 percent.
The multiplication of devotional gatherings has taken
place with seeming ease in both rural and urban areas. In
only 18 months, the number of individuals participating in
devotional gatherings in Asia grew by nearly 200 percent and
in the Americas and Europe by about 50 percent.
A marked increase in children’s classes has been reported
on all continents, confirming that they are also “a natural outgrowth of the training received early in the study of the main

52.54

52.51

52.52

52.55

52.56

379

52.52

52.55

Turning Point

52.57

52.58

sequence.”27 Efforts to multiply the number of children’s classes
in a strong cluster are predicated on training a sizable cadre
of children’s class teachers, and usually require a concerted
outreach to the community at large, as the Bahá’í children may
be few in number. Africa recorded the most significant rise in
children’s classes, with the number nearly doubling between
April 2001 and October 2002.
The multiplication of core activities in well-developed
clusters, growing out of increased individual initiative, has been
identified as an important step in advancing toward a program
of intensive growth. As the House of Justice wrote:
The coherence thus achieved through the establishment
of study circles, devotional meetings and children’s classes
provides the initial impulse for growth in a cluster, an impulse that gathers strength as these core activities multiply
in number.28

52.57

52.58

2.3.3 Reflection Meetings
52.59

A natural vehicle for multiplying core activities has been
reflection meetings. These meetings at the cluster level have
been particularly effective in well-established areas where an
expanding pool of human resources exists. In such gatherings
the institutions and the believers, many of whom are involved
in the institute process, study the relevant Five Year Plan documents, share experiences, and consult on the achievements and
strengths within the cluster. Avoiding “grandiose and elaborate
plans,”29 the friends reach a consensus on short-term goals
which reflect the pledges of individual initiatives and collective
actions that have emerged from the consultation. These goals
are generally incorporated into a calendar of activities that
becomes the framework for the subsequent two- to three‑month
period. In many clusters around the world, how to hold
productive and enjoyable reflection meetings has become an
important area for learning.

52.59

2.3.4 Reaching Out to All Inhabitants
52.60

What has helped clusters with a strong institute process
move toward the next stage of development has been the
efforts of Bahá’ís to open their communities to the public
at large and guide ready souls to the Cause in progressively
increasing numbers. In some of these advanced clusters, most
380

52.60

Additional Documents
of the ­participants in the first course of the institute have been
seekers.
52.61

It is evident, then, that a systematic approach to training has created a way for Bahá’ís to reach out to the surrounding society, share Bahá’u’lláh’s message with friends,
family, neighbors and coworkers, and expose them to the
richness of His teachings. This outward-looking orientation
is one of the finest fruits of the grassroots learning taking
place.30

52.61

52.62

In this regard the House of Justice calls attention to the
promising opportunities offered by devotional gatherings and
children’s classes:

52.62

52.63

As both activities are made open to the wider community
through a variety of well-conceived and imaginative means,
they attract a growing number of seekers, who, more
often than not, are eager to attend firesides and join study
circles. Many go on subsequently to declare their faith in
Bahá’u’lláh and, from the outset, view their role in the community as that of active participants in a dynamic process
of growth.31

52.63

52.64

Bahá’ís from Alaska to Australia, from Ireland to India,
have prepared imaginative brochures to attract seekers to their
devotional meetings. Family members, neighbors, and even
respondents to newspaper advertisements have been joining
the Bahá’ís for prayer and readings from the Scriptures, often
enhanced by music and followed by refreshments. Reports
from 75 percent of the national communities reveal that as of
October 2002, approximately 12,000 of the participants in
devotional meetings—20 percent—were non-Bahá’ís.
An equally effective form of outreach has been the active
extension of Bahá’í children’s classes to the greater community.
Parents of all backgrounds and strata of society are united in
their desire to guide their children to a better life. The response
to offers by Bahá’ís to provide children in an area with spiritual education has been extremely encouraging. According to
reports from two-thirds of the national communities, more
than 27,000, or 40 percent, of the children attending Bahá’í
classes at the present time are from non-Bahá’í families. In
such countries as Botswana, Lesotho, the Dominican Republic,
Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Puerto Rico, the Andaman and

52.64

52.65

381

52.65

Turning Point

52.66

52.67

52.68

Nicobar Islands, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, the Mariana
Islands, Albania, and Romania, as of October 2002, 75 percent
or more of the participants in their children’s classes were from
families of non-Bahá’ís.
The experience in the state of Tamil Nadu in India offers an example of a successful approach. Bahá’ís who had
completed institute training for children’s class teachers visited
selected villages in their cluster and held public meetings at
which they presented to the public, through the use of skits and
posters, the dangers facing children in today’s society and the
importance of spiritual education. Scores of parents enrolled
their children in Bahá’í classes, resulting in an unprecedented
increase in children’s classes in each of the target clusters. In
five clusters where previously there had been 28 classes, the
total rose to 136.
Wherever systematic efforts were made to invite receptive
parents who had children in Bahá’í classes or individuals who
were attending devotional meetings to join study circles, the
results were also encouraging. For these souls, their introduction to the Bahá’í Faith has been first and foremost the Word
of God. Connecting the seekers immediately with the Writings
of Bahá’u’lláh has been a uniformly effective approach, one
that recalls advice from the Guardian: “we are enjoined to
constantly refer the seeker to the Word itself.”32
It has also been reassuring to note that when non-Bahá’ís
realize there is no pressure or proselytizing involved, but rather
a genuine desire on the part of Bahá’ís to share the spiritual
sustenance in the Teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, they respond positively and readily return to Bahá’í gatherings on their own. A
program recently conducted in Medchal, India, offers a striking
example of such a response. A presentation on the Bahá’í
Faith’s perspective on moral education was delivered to 80
teachers and students at the Government Industrial Training
Institute. As a result of this event, more than half of those present chose to enroll in a study circle. Similarly, in Luxembourg
at the end of a public meeting organized by the Bahá’ís on the
spiritual education of children, 10 local residents registered for
a Bahá’í study circle.

2.4 Accelerating expansion and consolidation
in advanced clusters
2.4.1 Prerequisites for Intensive Growth
52.69

52.70

As the second year of the Five Year Plan draws to a close,
approximately 150 clusters worldwide have been identified as
having attained conditions propitious for intensive growth. In
many of these clusters the acceleration of the institute process
has resulted in 50 to 60 percent of the believers being fully
involved in institute courses, with a significant number having completed the current sequence. These highly motivated
friends, stimulated and nurtured by the encouragement of the
Local Spiritual Assemblies and Auxiliary Board members, have
undertaken more and more individual initiatives in the teaching
field. The number of core activities within these clusters has
increased at a seemingly exponential rate, and these “portals
for entry by troops” have become the channels for most of the
new enrollments in Bahá’í communities.
A high degree of enthusiasm and a strong sense of ownership are also characteristics of clusters ready to embark on
an intensive program of growth. Reflection meetings are well
attended and participation is lively. The feeling of ownership of
the process has been manifested in, among other ways, greater
contributions to the Fund. Though facing serious economic difficulties, the friends in the well-developed clusters in Moldova
and the Ukraine are contributing more generously than ever
to all the funds of the Faith. In an advanced priority cluster in
Nepal, the contributions of the believers to the National Fund
increased by 100 percent over the previous year.

52.69

52.70

2.4.2 Intensification of Teaching Efforts
52.71

52.72

The House of Justice stated in its message of 9 January 2001
that at the core of an intensive program of growth “must lie a
sound and steady process of expansion, matched by an equally
strong process of human resource development.” The teaching
work will include “a range of teaching efforts . . . involving
both activities undertaken by the individual and campaigns
promoted by the institutions.”33
In a letter to a National Assembly, the House of Justice
explained that the implementation of well-conceived teaching
projects,

383

52.71

52.72

Turning Point
52.73

which are linked with the systematic training of a large
number of believers for service to the Faith, . . . is an
important step towards invigorating and sustaining the
growth of the Cause.34

52.73

52.74

In its 17 January message the House of Justice has specifically
identified teaching projects as a step toward intensive growth:

52.74

52.75

. . . carefully designed projects are being added to the existing pattern of growth to reach receptive populations and
lift the rate of expansion to a higher level.35

52.75

52.76

In many parts of the world, “bringing large numbers into
the ranks of Bahá’u’lláh’s followers has traditionally not been
a formidable task.”36 With the institute system in advanced
clusters ready to absorb a periodic influx of new declarants, it is
now timely in such areas to initiate short-term, direct teaching
projects in order to “lift the rate of expansion to a higher level.”
A recent five-day teaching campaign in the Medak cluster in
Andhra Pradesh, India, led to 194 individuals’ embracing the
Faith, of which 114 immediately joined a first level institute
course. The House of Justice, in its 17 January message, praised
this course of action for the more developed clusters:

52.76

52.77

Such projects accelerate the tempo of teaching, already
on the rise through the efforts of individuals. And, where
large-scale enrollment is beginning to result, provision is
being made to ensure that a certain percentage of the new
believers immediately enter the institute program, for, as
we have emphasized in several messages, these friends will
be called upon to serve the needs of an ever-growing Bahá’í
population.37

52.77

52.78

After a sizable percentage of the new believers who have
enrolled through teaching projects join institute courses and
become integrated into core activities, another similar project
can soon be undertaken. Not only will periodic teaching
projects act as a catalyst for growth but continuing this cycle
of expansion and consolidation will help accelerate and sustain
the growth process.
Teaching projects will be especially effective if they are
“carefully designed” and reach specific segments of the population in a cluster. Teaching approaches and materials may be
tailored to persons, for example, of particular occupations
(schoolteachers, university students, lawyers), ethnicities

52.78

52.79

384

52.79

Additional Documents
(Aborigines, Chinese, Roma), and religions (animist, Buddhist,
Christian, Muslim), or to women and youth. After substantial
experience accumulates in the field as to the appropriate
methods and contexts for teaching special populations, Bahá’ís
involved in this work can assist the institute by designing a
course that is specific to a particular group; such a course could
be offered as a branch of the basic institute course on becoming
an effective teacher.
2.4.3 The Dynamics of Intensive Growth
52.80

52.81

A question often asked by the friends is how they will
know when their cluster is ready for an intensive program of
growth. One indicator that cannot be overlooked is growth
itself—an increase in the number of Bahá’ís in the cluster. A
vigorous institute process, the multiplication of core activities
and their integration, a successful outreach to local inhabitants,
an ever-growing number of individual and collective teaching
initiatives, a vibrant community life, and a commitment to an
ongoing learning process will result in growth. This includes
new enrollments as well as reactivated Bahá’ís who have been
roused by the newfound spirit and activity in their area. These
elements will also naturally lead to and foster the conditions for
intensive programs of growth identified by the House of Justice
in its message of 9 January 2001, such as the “pronounced
spirit of collaboration” among the institutions and “a reasonable degree of administrative capacity.”
An intensive program of growth suggests just that—
­intensification—an intensification of activity that contributes
to systematic growth. The friends in advanced clusters will
become aware of a perceptible change in the intensity of activity
in their area, and this will be reflected in the growth pattern. An
intensive program of growth implies a pattern that is progressively accelerated and fully sustained.

52.80

52.81

3. Enhancing Institutional Capacity
52.82

The process of dividing a country into clusters undertaken
in the first year of the Five Year Plan has made it possible
for the institutions of the Faith “to realize a pattern of wellordered expansion and consolidation.”38 National Assemblies
and Regional Councils have formulated their plans of action,
­supported by a system for training the necessary human
385

52.82

Turning Point

52.83

resources, with an eye toward moving clusters from one stage
of development to the next. And when an active cluster has the
necessary elements in place and is registering new enrollments,
it is the institutions that confirm its readiness to embark on an
intensive program of growth.
Achieving and sustaining intensive growth demand a variety
of capabilities and new approaches on the part of Bahá’í institutions. Reports indicate that the building of capacity, though
gradual, takes place more readily when members of institutions
have had first-hand experience with the dynamics of cluster
development and the processes that contribute to growth.

52.83

3.1 Managing the process of growth
52.84

In promoting and overseeing the process of growth, Bahá’í
institutions have been demonstrating a range of motivational
and organizational capacities. These skills are enhanced when
an attitude of learning prevails and an appreciation of the
essential harmony between individual initiative and collective
action exists.

52.84

3.1.1 Fostering an Encouraging Environment
52.85

52.86

Chief among the requirements for motivating believers
and nurturing a culture of growth is the capacity to foster
an encouraging environment where, as the Universal House
of Justice wrote in its 9 January message, “teaching is the
dominating passion of the lives of the believers” and “mutual
support, commitment to learning, and appreciation of diversity
of action are the prevailing norms.” In the same message, the
House of Justice also stated that an upsurge in teaching activity
depends on “sustained encouragement.”
In clusters preparing for intensive growth, it has been
observed that the collaborating institutions have demonstrated
the ability to create an atmosphere of mutual trust with the
friends, utilize their talents, praise their accomplishments, and
overlook minor mistakes. These are hallmarks of the emerging
Bahá’í culture, and the success of this Plan depends in no small
measure on the extent to which the institutions and individuals
alike demonstrate these capacities. In a letter written on his
behalf to a National Assembly, Shoghi Effendi made a comment
about encouragement that is relevant to institutions at all levels
of the Cause:

386

52.85

52.86

Additional Documents
52.87

. . . the National Body is like the beating of a healthy heart
in the midst of the Community, pumping spiritual love,
energy and encouragement out to all the members.39

52.87

3.1.2 Coordination at the Cluster Level
52.88

The actual work of promoting the process of growth in the
clusters requires skills of organization and coordination. These
functions are being carried out within a new framework of
collaboration, as described by the House of Justice:

52.88

52.89

The implementation of such a program [of intensive
growth] will require the close collaboration of the institute,
the Auxiliary Board members and their assistants, and an
Area Teaching Committee.40

52.89

52.90

To the extent that these institutions, through effective
­collaboration, have been able to systematically enlarge the pool
of human resources in a cluster and mobilize these resources for
teaching and other acts of service, they have been successful in
advancing the cluster toward a program of intensive growth.
Underlying their efforts has been the realization that success
would depend “on the manner in which lines of action are
integrated and on the attitude of learning that is adopted.”41
In clusters where well-functioning Local Spiritual
Assemblies exist, a coordinating committee has at times
replaced the role of an Area Teaching or Growth Committee
as the agency collaborating with the Auxiliary Board members
and the institute. In either case, meeting the challenges of furthering the institute process and promoting systematic growth
have required increasing administrative capacities, not the
least of which is effective consultation. The ability to organize
productive and enjoyable reflection meetings has also been a
feature of well-developed clusters.

52.90

52.91

52.91

3.1.3 The Ongoing Collection of Statistics
52.92

Managing the growth process necessitates certain practical
skills such as collecting statistics, because to monitor growth it
is essential to be able to measure it. The friends are learning to
maintain an accurate database at the grassroots by recording on
a regular basis such information as the number of ­individuals
going through the institute’s sequence of courses, the number
of core activities, the number of persons who attend these

387

52.92

Turning Point

activities, and the number of new enrollments. Special training
in collecting statistics has often been necessary for the friends
at the cluster level. This task needs to be carried out in such a
way that it does not overburden communities but provides data
sufficient for planning and for identifying measures to accelerate growth. Particular emphasis has been given to tracking the
statistics in the most promising clusters at about three-month
intervals, so that appropriate steps can be taken to move these
clusters toward intensive growth.
3.2 Reexamining administrative approaches
52.93

52.94

Gradually National Spiritual Assemblies are coming to
recognize that the administrative structures they put in place
in their national communities should reflect and support the
primary aim of the Plan. While in earlier years national committees and task forces were established for an array of local
and national activities and proclamation events, the current
focus on promoting systematic growth has influenced the
nature and number of committees a National Assembly may
wish to appoint. Some Assemblies, particularly in countries
with small national communities, have found it useful to reduce
the number of national committees to allow more time and
energy for the priorities of the Five Year Plan. Eliminating or
consolidating less vital committees has also enabled National
Assemblies to better fulfill their responsibilities for monitoring
the overall growth of the Faith in their countries and has freed
up the believers for teaching activities.
A significant development that has made it possible for
a number of National Spiritual Assemblies to modify the approach to their work was the establishment of Regional Bahá’í
Councils. Under the guidance of the House of Justice, these
National Assemblies are gradually learning to delegate responsibilities and authority to this new institution. Charged with
overseeing the plans for expansion and consolidation in their
regions, the Councils are able to analyze specific approaches to
be adopted in the execution of the Five Year Plan, and design
plans of action consisting “essentially of those provisions
needed to help each cluster in the region move from its current
stage of growth to the next advanced stage.”42 Again, the
result has been that the National Assemblies are free to focus
on larger strategic issues and other pressing matters, and the
teaching plans and priorities have become more responsive to
388

52.93

52.94

Additional Documents

52.95

52.96

52.97

52.98

the conditions and resources at the grassroots. In countries
where the organization of the teaching work has been carried
out by Regional Teaching Committees, under the supervision
of a National Teaching Committee, the benefits of this principle
of decentralization are evident as well.
Delegation of authority has also been exercised by National
Assemblies and Regional Councils with respect to Institute
Boards. In a letter written on its behalf, the House of Justice has
given the following advice on the delegation of responsibilities
and the administration of the institute process:
In the case of the boards of the regional institutes . . . one
of the challenges before the Regional Bahá’í Councils is to
delegate to them the functions that are properly theirs and
to give them the freedom needed to discharge those functions. The boards, likewise, have to provide enough latitude
to the coordinators of the institutes, and invest them with
enough authority, for them to perform their daily work
effectively. . . .
. . . The coordinator needs to operate at the level of
implementation, carrying out day-to-day plans and activities and ensuring that the basic function of the institute is
performed—this, with the assistance of the tutors and any
staff if necessary. The board oversees the institute process as
a whole, largely through the periodic reports of the coordinator and through occasional consultations. It will want to
make itself readily accessible to the coordinator, providing
the atmosphere in which he or she can share ideas, seek the
board’s views on the possibilities and challenges facing the
institute, and benefit from its advice. To carry out its role,
the board does not need to meet frequently, as does a committee charged with undertaking a set of specific tasks.
As for the Regional Council, it is, naturally, interested
to know that such an important agency under its aegis as
the institute is accomplishing the tasks for which it was
created and is functioning in full capacity. Even more
important, the Council must ensure that, as the ranks of
avowed supporters of the Faith swell through the institute
process, they are deployed in the field of service, reinforcing
the work of large-scale expansion and consolidation. This
multiplication and deployment of human resources is to be
carried out, of course, in the context of a regional plan to

389

52.95

Turning Point

move each cluster in the region from its current stage of
growth to the next advanced stage.43
52.99

Experience has indicated that when Institute Boards have
been given a sufficient degree of autonomy to administer
their work, they have been more effective in advancing the
institute process than those in countries where the Assemblies
or Councils have attempted to retain the process tightly within
their control.

52.99

3.3 Facilitating individual initiative
52.100

52.101

The growing contingents of friends eager to find their paths 52.100
of service have had implications for the role of Local Spiritual
Assemblies in the Five Year Plan and beyond. The House of
Justice calls attention to the challenge:
All of this opens thrilling opportunities for Local
Spiritual Assemblies. Theirs is the challenge, in collaboration with the Auxiliary Board members who counsel and
assist them, to utilize the energies and talents of the swelling human resources available in their respective areas of
jurisdiction both to create a vibrant community life and to
begin influencing the society around them.44

52.101

52.102

Intensive growth depends upon encouraging individuals to 52.102
carry out a rapidly increasing number of core activities and
other endeavors, and Local Assemblies have been instrumental
in this process. Through their inspiration and support, a host of
individual and collective actions have resulted. By recognizing
and facilitating the initiatives of the many friends proceeding
through the institute courses, as well as of other devoted
servants in their communities, the Assemblies are assuming a
style of leadership urged by the Guardian:

52.103

The first quality for leadership, both among individuals and 52.103
Assemblies, is the capacity to use the energy and competence that exists in the rank and file of its followers.45

52.104

Because the planning environment has now broadened to 52.104
the level of the cluster, often involving several Local Assemblies
and the active participation of the believers in formulating
short-term goals, an Assembly’s scope of interest has begun
to stretch beyond its boundaries. Its vision is expanded, its resources magnified, and its opportunities enlarged. In describing

390

Additional Documents
the character of cluster meetings, the House of Justice alludes
to features of this wider perspective:
52.105

The Universal House of Justice hopes that the consultations 52.105
which take place in periodic meetings at the level of the
cluster will generate such unity of thought about the growth
of the Faith that, in those cases where the lines of action
affect localities with Local Assemblies, the requirement
of receiving their approval will easily be met. It should be
remembered that the aim of such consultations, beyond
addressing certain practical considerations, is to maintain
a high level of enthusiasm and to create a spirit of service
and fellowship among those present. Discussions should
not become bogged down by undue concern for procedural
issues, but should focus on what can be achieved and on
the joy of witnessing the fruits of hard work and diligent
effort.46
3.4 Serving large numbers

52.106

The challenges of growth will test and develop the capacities 52.106
of our institutions at all levels, but ultimately these bodies were
designed to serve large numbers of people. Indeed, “so much
of the ability of the Faith to develop capacity for community
building depends upon the size of our membership.”47 Shoghi
Effendi has assured us that growth is the answer to fulfilling the
potentialities of our Administrative Order:

52.107

The problems which confront the believers at the 52.107
present time, whether social, spiritual, economic or administrative, will be gradually solved as the number and
the resources of the friends multiply and their capacity for
service . . . develops.48

52.108
52.109

52.110

And in the same vein, the Universal House of Justice states:

52.108

A massive expansion of the Bahá’í community must be 52.109
achieved far beyond all past records. . . . The need for this
is critical, for without it the laboriously erected agencies of
the Administrative Order will not be provided the scope to
be able to develop and adequately demonstrate their inherent capacity to minister to the crying needs of humanity in
its hour of deepening despair.49
The ability to guide and sustain a growth process will
contribute toward the capacity and maturation of institutions
391

52.110

Turning Point

at all levels. The House of Justice highlighted this point in its
Rid. ván message at the beginning of the Four Year Plan:
52.111

. . . the maturity of the Spiritual Assembly must be measured not only by the regularity of its meetings and the
efficiency of its functioning, but also by the continuity of
the growth of Bahá’í membership.50

52.111

52.112

This maturation comes about through the enhancement of the
capabilities of Bahá’í institutions as they are involved in promoting growth, responding to the needs of increasing numbers
of believers, and facilitating their service to the Cause.

52.112

4. Change in the Culture of the Bahá’í Community
At the end of the Four Year Plan the Universal House of 52.113
Justice wrote that “the culture of the Bahá’í community [had]
experienced a change.”51 The “new patterns of thought and
action”52 introduced by the training institutes were having a
profound impact on individuals, institutions, and communities. Fundamental to this new orientation was an attitude of
learning, along with an appreciation of systematization and
focus, a commitment to enlisting a greater number of believers
in the work of the Cause, and a conscious outreach to society
at large.
52.114
At the level of the cluster and the community, where the 52.114
culture of learning is taking root, a new dynamic has emerged
whereby the friends are engaged in actions that are purposeful,
systematic, and energizing.
52.113

4.1 Learning and planning at the grassroots
52.115

Two observations that are important to the ongoing 52.115
prosecution of the Five Year Plan can be made about the
experience of working in clusters. First, reflection meetings
have become the learning matrix of the clusters. These periodic
consultations have enabled the believers to “reflect on issues,
consider adjustments, and maintain enthusiasm and unity
of thought.”53 The value of short-term goals is immediately
recognized, as accomplishments and challenges can regularly be
evaluated, “obstacles removed, resources multiplied and lessons
learned,”54 and modifications in the goals made without losing
continuity of action. Flexibility and patience are encouraged,
as essential prerequisites of the learning process. The friends
392

Additional Documents
have begun to appreciate that not all answers can be tied down
in advance but are garnered through experience. In describing
this process, the House of Justice wrote:
52.116

Meetings of consultation held at the cluster level serve to
raise awareness of possibilities and generate enthusiasm.
Here, free from the demands of formal decision-making,
participants reflect on experience gained, share insights,
explore approaches and acquire a better understanding of
how each can contribute to achieving the aim of the Plan. In
many cases, such interaction leads to consensus on a set of
short-term goals, both individual and collective. Learning
in action is becoming the outstanding feature of the emerging mode of operation.55

52.116

52.117

A second critical feature of working in clusters is the shift
to planning at the grassroots. The House of Justice described
this as one of the purposes of the clustering exercise, but its
implications for the roles of individuals and local institutions
in implementing the Plan are only beginning to be felt. Rather
than “the mere enumeration of goals,”56 often unconnected to
the realities of the resources in an area, planning at reflection
gatherings is based on the human resources actually available.
The impact of the training institute on the planning process
and the stimulation of individual initiative has been widely
seen. Armed with new insights, skills, and abilities, individuals
have arisen in cluster after cluster to take up tasks in support
of their area plan. Through the encouragement of the institutions, particularly the Auxiliary Board members, enthusiasm
for service has been generated and guided “into channels of
systematic endeavor.”57

52.117

4.2 Maintaining a focus
52.118

52.119

At Bahá’í institutional meetings and other gatherings in 52.118
every country of the world, one is struck by the clear and
common focus demonstrated by the friends in their efforts to
advance the process of entry by troops. The House of Justice
associated this development with the change in culture:
. . . since the beginning of the Four Year Plan, the entire
Bahá’í world has been undergoing a profound change in
culture required by the single focus of the global Plans in
this latter part of the first century of the Faith’s Formative
Age—advancing the process of entry by troops.58
393

52.119

Turning Point

Accustomed to pursuing a wide range of goals at the national 52.120
and local levels, many Bahá’ís faced the challenge of focusing
their teaching and other forms of service more directly on
advancing this overriding aim of the Plan. While a “diversity
of action” was expected, the guidance of the House of Justice
provided an explicit framework for that action, and the
believers became aware that “old modes of thinking, which,
while valuable in many respects, have not been conducive to
rapid growth.”59
52.121
Coupled with the focus on advancing the process of entry 52.121
by troops is a growing appreciation of the need to be systematic
in action. Growth should not be explosive and short-lived but
steady and sustained. By definition, a process means a systematic
series of actions directed toward a specific end. A systematic
approach to training human resources is already yielding substantial results, and the systematization of the teaching work
through the movement of clusters is demonstrating its efficacy.
As stated at the outset of this document, it is “concentrated and
sustained attention” to these two movements that will lead to
the fulfillment of the aim of the Five Year Plan.
52.120

4.3 Empowering the rank and file
52.122

Referred to as the “chief propellant” of the change in 52.122
culture, the training institutes, with their ability to produce an
expanding number of human resources, have fundamentally
altered the approach of the Bahá’í community to the tasks at
hand. More than ever the rank and file of the believers are
involved in meaningful and vital service to the Cause. Whether
by holding devotional meetings, facilitating study circles, or
teaching children’s classes, a greater number of friends have
found paths of service that do not depend on public-speaking
prowess. The training institutes have imparted the necessary
“spiritual insights,” “knowledge,” and “skills” that have enabled the believers to “facilitate the process of entry by troops
with efficiency and love.”60 The House of Justice has remarked
on this accomplishment:

52.123

It is especially gratifying to note the high degree of 52.123
participation of believers in the various aspects of the
growth process. In cluster after cluster, the number of those
shouldering the responsibilities of expansion and consolidation is steadily increasing.61
394

Additional Documents
52.124

52.125

The growing confidence and commitment of the believers, 52.124
which have been reflected “in the thrust of individual initiatives,”62 are gathering momentum in the Five Year Plan. In this
regard the House of Justice has reassured the friends that
as the believers gain confidence in their capacity to serve
through the institute process, a much richer expression of
the diverse talents of the friends is beginning to appear in
the Bahá’í world—a richness that bodes well for the future
progress of the Cause.63

52.125

4.4 An “outward-looking orientation”
When the Universal House of Justice called on the Bahá’ís
at the beginning of the Five Year Plan to open their study
circles, children’s classes, and devotional meetings “to all the
inhabitants of the locality,” that phrase signalized a change in
the culture of Bahá’í communities, a change that is intimately
linked with the efforts of the Faith to grow and to embrace
humankind.
52.127
In reaching out to all inhabitants of a locality we are
inspired by the words of Bahá’u’lláh: “This Day a door is open
wider than both heaven and earth.”64 Making a concerted effort
to open the portals of our community life to the outside world
requires both courage and imagination. Stories abound of the
creative measures Bahá’í communities around the globe are
employing to attract seekers to their activities.
52.128
Beyond opening the doors of the Bahá’í community to the
outside world, the believers are also exerting themselves to
reach out. Bahá’ís are striving to expand their social circles and
ultimately their friendships, as friendship is the surest foundation for touching the hearts. To pursue these aims, individuals
have begun to examine their priorities, including the services
they are rendering the Faith, and to reorder their lives so as to
allow themselves more time for interaction with their relatives,
friends, and coworkers. Ultimately, what is the point of striving
to become more effective teachers if we are not meeting people
to teach?
52.129
Having an “outward-looking orientation” also suggests
that it is important for Bahá’ís to understand more deeply the
forces operating on the world stage and the solutions offered
by the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. Our task is to convey to
seekers that we are all living in the same world, facing common
52.126

395

52.126

52.127

52.128

52.129

Turning Point

trials, and striving to fulfill similar, long-held aspirations for
the ­human race. Our expressions of solidarity with our fellow
human beings must be sincerely voiced and genuinely felt.

5. The Movement of Humanity toward Bahá’u’lláh
52.130
52.131

A premise underlying our current teaching efforts is the 52.130
realization that all humanity is moving toward Bahá’u’lláh.
Let there be no doubt that what we are witnessing is the
gathering momentum of that process of the entry of humanity into the Cause by troops, foreshadowed in Bahá’u’lláh’s
Tablet to the King of Persia, eagerly anticipated by the
Master, and described by the Guardian as the necessary
prelude to mass conversion.65

52.131

Not everyone learns or responds at the same rate but the path to 52.132
Him is wide enough to accommodate one and all regardless of
their pace. “The Cause of God has room for all”66 suggests that
not only are divers peoples welcome but that individuals may
be at different points in their understanding and acceptance of
the Faith. Adopting an attitude of openness and inclusion will
help diminish the sharp line that believers have sometimes
tended to draw between themselves and the public at large.
52.133
Bahá’ís everywhere are also acutely aware that events 52.133
outside the Faith are serving, as the Universal House of Justice
wrote, “to awaken in the hearts of those who share this planet
with us a longing for unity and justice that can be met only by
the Cause of God.”67 All of the plans, campaigns, and reflection meetings are aimed at finding ways to share the Divine
Message with the waiting masses. Above all, the friends should
be encouraged to remember Bahá’u’lláh’s call “This is the day
in which to speak,”68 and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s exhortation that we
“should strive with our whole hearts to offer ourselves up,
guide others to His path, and train the souls of men.”69

Impact of Growth on
Administration Processes
a document prepared by
the International Teaching Centre
July 2005

53.1

53.2

53.3

The dramatic progress achieved on all continents in the course
of the Five Year Plan has been reflected in many aspects of the
life of the Bahá’í community. The training institute process has
continued to enhance the capacity of an increasing number of
believers to promote the processes of expansion and consolidation. The enhanced sense of ownership and enthusiasm thus
generated, reflected in a marked increase in individual initiative,
has been especially evident in advanced clusters where the
renewed teaching fervor of the friends is directed towards
intensive programs of growth.
One of the welcome results of this new vibrancy is that
there is a growing contingent of believers involved in the
work of the Cause, serving in numerous capacities within the
framework of the Plan. Meanwhile an expanding community of
interest is challenging the Bahá’í community to re-conceptualize
its boundaries and cater to the requirements of an ever-swelling body of individuals walking together the path towards
Bahá’u’lláh. The progress made has been reinforced by the
emergence of a new culture of growth in the community.
As these developments have continued at an accelerating
pace, several national communities have taken steps to reframe
their administrative arrangements, so as to align them with the
new requirements. Below is a review of some of the most salient
aspects of the developments which impinge on the administration of the processes of growth. This review reflects the experiences of communities in the advance guard of these processes.
Whereas in some instances the changes have been relatively
397

53.1

53.2

53.3

Turning Point

minor and adjustments easily made, in other cases they have
necessitated a major rethinking of structures and practices.

Administering the Process of Growth at the Cluster Level
53.4

53.5

53.6

53.7

With the division of countries into small geographic areas,
the cluster construct has created a new arena within which the
teaching work can be organized on a manageable scale. Largescale expansion in the past had proven difficult to sustain.
Whilst this was principally owing to lack of a systematic process for raising human resources, there was also limited experience with managing the process of growth at the grassroots.
In this context, the learning that has been achieved about the
administration of growth at the cluster level constitutes one of
the major accomplishments in the current Plan.
In its 9 January 2001 letter, the Universal House of Justice
placed the locus of the cluster planning work on three entities
at the cluster level: “The implementation of such a program will
require the close collaboration of the institute, the Auxiliary
Board members and their assistants, and an Area Teaching
Committee.” In advanced clusters these entities are directly
focused on the planning and execution of teaching plans, ensuring that the victories are immediately consolidated, learning is
captured, and appropriate adjustments quickly made. Taken
together, the three agencies constitute a strong infrastructure,
making it possible for many decisions related to the process of
growth to be made by those most intimately involved in their
execution.
As the specific responsibilities of agencies operating at the
cluster level became defined by the House of Justice, in several
countries detailed documents that set out the scheme of coordination involving these agencies and their ancillary arms have
been developed. Often modelled on the first such paper that
was developed in India, these have assisted in clarifying roles
and removing ambiguities. These documents have also formed
the basis in these countries of the training and orientation of the
members of the agencies, necessarily an ongoing process which
continues to be refined in light of experience.
One instance of the training required by the Area Teaching
Committee occurred in an advanced cluster in Mongolia. There,
the sharp increase in new believers and the complexity of managing the consequent rise in consolidation activities highlighted
398

53.4

53.5

53.6

53.7

Additional Documents

53.8

53.9

53.10

the urgent need for training of the members of the Committee
as well as of members of the Local Spiritual Assemblies in the
cluster. The training included a range of important organizational capabilities—data collection and analysis, team building,
and computer skills. The collaboration of the Committee, the
institute coordinators, and the Auxiliary Board members has
enabled this cluster to scale remarkable heights in expansion,
consolidation, and human resource development.
A critically important aspect which cannot be deferred for
long is the significant investment of time required from the cluster agencies, in particular the training institute coordinator and
the secretary of the Area Teaching Committee—occasionally
referred to as the cluster development facilitator. Experience is
showing that where the number of core activities, the various
campaigns related to the teaching work, and the tasks related to
the collection of statistics, among other duties, reach a certain
level of complexity, part- and eventually full-time workers are
required. In such instances, institute coordinators and development facilitators, functioning with increasing effectiveness, are
proving indispensable to the greater mobilization of the rank
and file of the believers and the continuity of teaching and
consolidation efforts.
The question is not initially related to whether such staff
are remunerated—in many clusters the services of volunteers
in these posts are being effectively harnessed. Rather, the issue
is one of recognising that the management of the processes
of growth requires intensive effort on the part of a dedicated
team of individuals functioning in clearly defined spheres at the
grassroots. Eventually, of course, it will not be possible for the
work to be carried out on a purely voluntary basis and, in time,
individuals will need to be employed. Where remuneration is
required, new challenges arise related to the use of the funds,
and the way in which they are to be generated within the cluster
and augmented from outside as necessary. Another challenge
is ensuring that a flexible approach is adopted to allow for
various employment arrangements.
Another important consideration is that the sizeable
enlargement of the community of interest is proving a spur to
the friends and institutions to adopt approaches that minimize
the demarcation between Bahá’ís and non-Bahá’ís. As core
activities attract an increasing number of participants, the
challenge is to meet their needs by making them feel at home
399

53.8

53.9

53.10

Turning Point

within a Bahá’í environment. To administer this new element
of the community requires intimate knowledge of their needs
and application of systematic attention. It involves regularly
communicating with them, engaging them in a single discourse,
readily utilising their services and learning how to guide them to
an ever increasing commitment to the Cause. All this is greatly
facilitated by having agencies that can function at the cluster
level, for this is the arrowhead of learning about all aspects of
the growth process. The cluster agencies can put in place the
necessary elements such as creating a special newsletter aimed
at the community of interest, engaging these new friends in the
work of the cluster, or assisting Local Spiritual Assemblies to
play their own part in this regard.

Involvement of Local Spiritual Assemblies
53.11

53.12

53.13

The role of the Local Spiritual Assembly is, like that of all
other institutions, an evolutionary one, which will develop in
relation to the processes of growth. Although observations in
this area are still rather preliminary, certain broad conclusions
are already discernible. Where Local Assemblies have acquired
the new vision of growth and adjusted to the requirements of
operating within the context of the cluster, they have greatly
enhanced the teaching work. Conversely, where there has been
resistance to the new realities, the process of growth has been
adversely affected.
It is instructive to note the effective role that Local Spiritual
Assemblies have played in many clusters. In several countries
where Assemblies had a low level of functioning, a significant
revival of Assemblies in advanced clusters has been observed.
The believers are taking responsibility for the election of their
Assembly and, once formed, the Assembly is assuming greater
responsibility for the affairs of the Cause than ever before.
In other instances, particularly in the context of intensive
programs of growth, Local Assemblies with a high level of
functioning are rising to the challenges created by the program.
Such Assemblies have effectively reinforced the cluster plan
formulated by the cluster agencies and assumed responsibility
for certain elements of the endeavor within their own area.
Given that the geographic scope of the planning involved often
extends to several localities, a useful practice in the initial stages
of development has been for the cluster agencies to share the
400

53.11

53.12

53.13

Additional Documents

53.14

53.15

53.16

proposed plan with the Local Spiritual Assemblies in the area.
This approach can enhance the Assemblies’ ability to lend their
support to the program, and encourages them to take steps
to reinforce it in their localities. An example of where this is
happening in many instances is the United States.
As teaching efforts and core activities have multiplied, Local
Assemblies have been thrilled to see the opportunities created
for serving the wider population. For example, an Assembly
in whose area children’s classes have multiplied in various
neighbourhoods is delighted to know that the community in its
charge is able to administer to a greater number of the children
of the locality than it was ever possible before. Yet beyond
the increased capacity for outreach, the positive effect on the
quality of Bahá’í community life has also been reported and is
reflected in the enhanced quality of its internal processes.
These conclusions are drawn in part from a survey
conducted by the International Teaching Centre in about fifty
advanced clusters throughout the world. The study which assessed the impact of the process of growth on several aspects of
Bahá’í community life identified that 90 percent of the surveyed
clusters had experienced improvements in the Nineteen Day
Feast, with nearly two-thirds of them also recording a rise in
participation levels. Insights gained from conducting devotional
gatherings are increasingly reflected in the spiritual program
of the Feast. According to the survey, even the consultative
processes at all levels in the community—including Assembly
meetings—have improved in efficacy, becoming more purposeful, united, and focused. It has also been observed that in many
instances contributions to the Bahá’í Fund have been positively
impacted as levels of commitment and consciousness about its
spiritual significance have increased. These successes are owed
to the effect of the institute process which, fostering a deep
spiritual transformation, has proven more effective in dealing
with great numbers of people than most efforts at community
and Spiritual Assembly development.
The survey indicated that the most significant initial contribution of Local Assemblies to the processes of growth was
providing encouragement to the believers. This was particularly
effective when an expansion of vision had resulted from the
participation of Assembly members in the institute process as
well as the study of Five Year Plan documents. Interactions with
the cluster agencies were also identified as enabling Assemblies
401

53.14

53.15

53.16

Turning Point

53.17

to make effective contributions. Such interactions often occur
at the cluster level in the context of particular plans of action.
Another effective approach to building unity of vision and action has been the convening of conferences for Local Assembly
members. This approach has been employed in Canada where
such gatherings held at the regional or cluster level by Regional
Bahá’í Councils have done much to assist Local Assemblies to
realign their administrative processes and priorities.
Beyond these considerations, the leadership role of the
Spiritual Assemblies—be they national or local—is of profound
importance. It has been observed in many clusters that the
processes of growth are greatly enhanced where this leadership
role is exercised through the Assemblies’ constant effort to
maintain the vision of growth before the believers, allowing
for the two essential movements to impact priorities, avoiding
unnecessary distractions, providing the necessary resources, and
reinforcing the plans and initiatives at the cluster level. Further,
the dynamic force of individual example as the members of
Assemblies themselves become personally involved in the
cluster activities, actively supporting the efforts of the cluster
agencies, is imperative.

53.17

Decentralization and Regional Bahá’í Councils
53.18

53.19

Given the far-reaching developments occurring at the
level of the cluster and as more intensive programs of growth
are launched, decentralization of administrative processes
becomes ever more important. Accordingly, the strengthening of Regional Bahá’í Councils, where these exist, takes on
added significance. The main consideration is related to the
devolution of the decision making process to the appropriate
level of the Bahá’í administration. In practice, this principle
applies both to the devolution of decision making by National
Spiritual Assemblies to the regional level, and by the Regional
Bahá’í Council to the cluster level. It is increasingly evident
that where the framework of the Five Year Plan has been well
understood by Regional Councils, through their stewardship of
the expansion and consolidation processes in their regions, the
aim of a significant advance in the process of entry by troops
is becoming realized.
One approach to the question of decentralization would
be to focus on the relationship of the Councils with the
402

53.18

53.19

Additional Documents

53.20

53.21

Counsellors, the National Assembly, national committees,
and offices of the National Center, looking at the hierarchy of
the various entities involved. However, more relevant to the
relation between decentralization and the aim of advancing
the process of entry by troops would be a consideration of
whether the administrative structures are consistent with and
conducive to growth at the cluster level, particularly large-scale
growth. What many countries are learning is to construct the
vision of administrative processes that affect growth from the
cluster upwards, asking at each stage what arrangements will
best advance the process of entry by troops in this new arena
of action.
What is being learnt, then, is that an effective administration with regard to the teaching work is one that aims to
release the power of individual initiative, providing the flow
of resources and freedom of operation to the coordinating
structures at the cluster level. Indeed, one national community
which is undertaking a wide-ranging review of its administrative processes, India, began by considering the reality at the
level of the cluster, and considered what processes would
most effectively ensure the promotion of growth. For this
purpose, administration was conceptualized as constituting
the channels to facilitate a series of necessary flows—flows
of guidance, direction, encouragement, human resources,
literature, and information, including statistics.
The challenge of gathering accurate statistics is being
addressed in many countries through the application of the
Statistical Report Program (SRP) devised by the Department of
Statistics at the Bahá’í World Centre. What this program facilitates is the gathering and analysis of key data that enable an
accurate and timely picture of the development of the community to be built up. Aggregating the information at the cluster,
region, and country levels, SRP provides an important tool for
Bahá’í institutions in their decision making process, enabling
the prioritization of resources and lines of action at each
level of the administration. Although initially the program will
require the investment of some effort to train a few individuals
in its use and to enter the base data, once in place it is proving
a valuable aid to the process of decentralization. Countries that

Impact on Administrative Processes at the National Level

The ongoing process of decentralization necessitated by
the Five Year Plan carries with it profound implications for
administration at the national and regional levels. As national
communities review their administrative structures, it is heartening to note that in many instances they are doing so in anticipation of a community that is several fold larger in size. Such
a perspective is necessitating a significant shift in resources to
the regional and cluster levels, as well as inevitable concomitant
changes in the size and structure of the National Office.
As stated above, in the vanguard of this administrative
review is India where the institutions have, at the encouragement of the House of Justice, begun to reassess and modify
the national administration in that country to become better
equipped for sustaining and extending the remarkable growth
that has been achieved. The challenge has been enthusiastically
embraced and has already brought with it a reorganization of
the national treasury office, a restructuring of some of the national agencies, and a streamlining of the flow of information,
including statistics.
One area that has required a fresh perspective in many
countries is how the national budget reflects and reinforces the
priorities of the Plan: human resource development and the
advancement of clusters. Where the expansion and consolidation work effectively devolves upon the Councils, in some
communities a substantial transfer of funds to these bodies has
occurred, as well as an assessment of the resources needed for
sustaining intensive programs of growth at the cluster level.
New budget analyses and formulations have taken into account
the decentralization necessary to fulfill the singularly important
aim of a significant advance in the process of entry by troops.
In the United Kingdom the National Assembly, responding
to the demands of the Plan, reassessed its staffing situation
at the national level and managed through streamlining of
functions and consolidation of posts to release the necessary
funds to substantially increase the financial support for regional
institutions. This step, begun in 2002, made it possible to
appoint the first full-time regional training institute coordinator, and later to fund a second post, as well as providing the
financial support for positions at the cluster level as these
become ­ necessary—measures which are making a direct and

decisive impact on the impressive development of the process
of growth in that country.
The statement in the document “Building Momentum:
A Coherent Approach to Growth” related to re-examining
administrative approaches has led many national communities
to undertake a process of reflection in light of the realities and
requirements of promoting a culture of growth. In several cases
the number of national committees has been radically reduced to
ensure that the processes of growth receive the appropriate priority and that as many believers as possible are released to focus on
the teaching work. Kenya and Germany are notable examples.
In several countries, the mandates of committees whose
functions directly impinge on the processes of growth—such
as the National Teaching Committee, the National Child
Education Committee, and the National Youth Committee—
have been carefully reviewed not only to ensure alignment
with the aims of the Plan but also to examine whether any
elements are already covered by other agencies, thus obviating
the duplication of effort. In some cases these committees, once
considered mandatory, have been deactivated where it has
become clear that the essential aspects of their work are already
being conducted by other agencies, such as Regional Bahá’í
Councils, or training institutes. In Australia increased capacity
at the grassroots made it possible for the responsibilities of
the National Child Education Committee to be successfully
devolved to the Regional Bahá’í Councils.
Clearly, questions related to the role of any particular
committee must be decided on a case-by-case basis and no
prescription can be provided that would fit every eventuality.
Nevertheless, the principle that the new circumstances created
by the Five Year Plan necessitate a reconsideration of administrative arrangements at the national level is increasingly being
recognized in many countries.

The emerging experience in the Bahá’í world, reflected in
the foregoing observations, is an impressive fruit of the learning
mode increasingly evident in every department of the life of the
community. As the processes of growth gather pace, there is
every expectation that administrative processes and structures
will continue to evolve in response to the particular exigencies
of each new stage.
