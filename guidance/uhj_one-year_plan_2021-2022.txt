The One Year Plan
2021-2022
Messages of the Universal House of Justice

This Riḍván marks the conclusion of an extraordinary year, of
a Five Year Plan, and of an entire series of Plans that began in
1996. A new series of Plans beckons, with what promises to be
a momentous twelve months serving as a prelude to a nine-year
effort due to commence next Riḍván. We see before us a
community that has rapidly gained strength and is ready to
take great strides forward. But there must be no illusions about
how much striving was required to reach this point and how
hard-won were the insights acquired along the way: the lessons
learned will shape the community’s future, and the account of
how they were learned sheds light on what is to come.

To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
We greet you with immense affection on this special
day, an occasion for calling to mind the power of the
Covenant, that power which “pulsateth in the body of
the contingent world” and forges enduring bonds of
love among the believers. In the months since Riḍván,
we have seen the evidences of this dynamic power in
the unified activity of Bahá’u’lláh’s followers, led so
ably by the institutions of the Cause in each continent
and country, as the friends everywhere have sought
with characteristic creativity and determination to minister to the needs of an ailing world. Your resilience and
your unwavering commitment to the well-being of
those around you, persistent through all difficulties,
have filled us with tremendous hope. But it is no wonder that, in some other quarters, hope has become a depleted resource. There is a mounting realization on the
part of the world’s people that the decades ahead are set
to bring with them challenges among the most daunting
that the human family has ever had to face. The current
global health crisis is but one such challenge, the ultimate severity of whose cost, both to lives and livelihoods, is yet unknown; your efforts to succour and support one another as well as your sisters and brothers in
society at large will certainly need to be sustained, and
in places expanded.

1

1.1

1.2

It is against this background of furious storms lashing humanity that the ark of the Cause is about to embark upon a series of Plans that will carry it into the
third century of the Bahá’í Era and significantly
strengthen the Bahá’í community’s capacity for realizing the society-building powers of the Faith. As you are
aware, the first Plan to commence this new series will
last but one year. In places where circumstances prevent
national communities from establishing as many intensive programmes of growth before Riḍván 2021 as they
intended, these twelve months will extend the time
available to them to do so. Meanwhile, wherever the
process of growth has already been intensified, the year
will be an opportunity to consolidate the achievements
made during the current Plan, while cultivating the conditions necessary for welcoming larger and larger numbers of souls into the embrace of a community recognized for its fortitude and outward-looking orientation.
At the national, regional, and cluster levels, we look to
communities of proven strength to help those in which
less experience has accrued. In this year-long effort, every community must draw on whatever untapped potential it may possess and seek to overcome any obstacles that are impeding its growth, thereby preparing it
for the demands to come. For it is within the context of
a flourishing community, especially a centre of intense
activity in a village or neighbourhood, and when each
element of the Plan’s framework is given the a�ention it
requires, that those elements most visibly cohere and
connect, multiplying the community’s powers in the
field of action.

2

Besides providing for advances within clusters everywhere, the coming Plan will be a year for profound
reflection on the life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the strength of
the Covenant of which He was the Centre, as the community prepares to commemorate the centenary of His
Ascension. The observance of this anniversary will undoubtedly prompt individuals and communities alike
to contemplate the significance of that infinitely poignant
moment when He Who was the Mystery of God departed from this world. His passing took from the
Bahá’ís of that era a Figure Who was the object of their
ardent love and loyalty; to the faithful of this age, He remains without parallel: a perfect embodiment in word
and deed of all that His Father taught, the One through
Whom the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh was “proclaimed,
championed and vindicated”. We are conscious that the
coming year will also mark a century since His Will and
Testament—that “momentous”, “historic”, “immortal”
Document—“called into being, outlined the features
and set in motion the processes” of the Administrative
Order, “the very pa�ern of that divine civilization
which the almighty Law of Bahá’u’lláh is designed to establish upon earth”. This “unique” and “divinely-conceived” Order, this “mighty administrative structure”,
had been fashioned by its Architect to perpetuate the
Covenant and channel the spiritual powers of the
Cause. It will be apparent, then, that the Day of the
Covenant next year, exactly twelve months from now,
will be especially meaningful. We ask National Spiritual
Assemblies to determine how these two dates, occurring so close together, may each be observed, taking into
account prevailing conditions in their countries.

3

1.3

1.4

All the while, earnest preparations continue to be
made in the Holy Land for the commemoration of the
centenary of the Ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at a gathering at which, it is hoped, representatives of National
Spiritual Assemblies and Regional Bahá’í Councils will
be present. Similarly, plans are already being made for
the conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors
and Auxiliary Board members, which will coincide, in
January 2022, with the lapse of one hundred years since
the first public reading of the Will and Testament of the
Master. Conditions in the world may, of course, require
the plans being made for these gatherings at the Bahá’í
World Centre to change. But come what may, we have
no doubt that the efforts made in local communities
worldwide to befi�ingly commemorate the Ascension
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and to honour the Day of the Covenant
in this coming centennial year will provide the impetus
needed to launch the succeeding stage in God’s Minor
Plan, even as Providence propels the unfoldment of His
Major Plan in accordance with His incontestable decree.

1.5

The momentum that is sure to build with each successive cycle of the One Year Plan will be further augmented by the release of two films. The first of these,
which will become available in time for the centennial
commemoration, will be a portrait of the Person of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Besides being a tribute to His life and
work, it will explore how, by championing the oneness
of humanity through His words and deeds, He offered
a challenge to the stale assumptions and prejudices of
the age, and gave stimulus to a process of unification
which continues to this day. A second film, following

4

soon after the first, will reflect on the expiration of
the first hundred years of the Formative Age from the
vantage point of the heights to which the Bahá’í community
has climbed, and from where it can now gaze upon
new horizons.
The significance of the occasions being marked during the One Year Plan will lend it a unique character, enhancing the work being undertaken in clusters and
making this single year the ideal preparation for the
global endeavour that is to follow. With a sense of joyful
anticipation, we announce that the Bahá’í world will, at
Riḍván 2022, begin a Nine Year Plan. Its requirements
and provisions will be set out at a later date, but its duration already gives an unmistakable indication of the
expansive prospect it will present. God willing, it will
be heralded by the convocation of a series of conferences held over a span of months across the globe.

1.6

This, so far as it can be foreseen, is the course the
Bahá’í community will seek to tread. For the present
hour, we urge you to recommit your energies, keeping
your focus on the mission immediately before you. We
are immensely gratified to see the assured composure
with which the community of the Greatest Name has
sought to offer the divine remedy under all conditions,
especially during this period when society’s established
pa�erns of life have been disrupted and risks of different kinds are being faced by so many. Withal, the
friends must guard against being drawn into the ultimately futile conflict and strife that characterizes so
much of the discussion of the affairs of society, or—

1.7

5

heaven forbid—allowing interaction of this type to permeate, even fleetingly, the conversations of the community. Yet such vigilance on your part in avoiding discord
and in not becoming entangled in society’s controversies should under no circumstances be construed as
aloofness from the many pressing concerns of this time.
Far from it. You are among the most active and earnest
of humanity’s well-wishers. But, whether through deeds
or words, the merit of your every contribution to social
well-being lies, first, in your resolute commitment to
discover that precious point of unity where contrasting
perspectives overlap and around which contending
peoples can coalesce.
1.8

Less than two full cycles remain of the present Five
Year Plan—indeed, of the current series of Plans inaugurated in 1996. In these closing months, we will be sure to
offer ardent prayers on your behalf in our supplications
at the Sacred Threshold. May you succeed in giving
hope to those who know not where to find it in a world
disoriented and adrift, sorely lacking the unity which
you, through your heart-pledged devotion to the
Covenant, so conspicuously manifest.

Riḍván 2021

To the Bahá’ís of the World
Dearly loved Friends,
The final words in a most memorable chapter in the
history of the Cause have now been wri�en, and the
page turns. This Riḍván marks the conclusion of an
extraordinary year, of a Five Year Plan, and of an entire
series of Plans that began in 1996. A new series of Plans
beckons, with what promises to be a momentous
twelve months serving as a prelude to a nine-year
effort due to commence next Riḍván. We see before us
a community that has rapidly gained strength and is
ready to take great strides forward. But there must be
no illusions about how much striving was required to
reach this point and how hard-won were the insights
acquired along the way: the lessons learned will shape
the community’s future, and the account of how they
were learned sheds light on what is to come.

2.1

The decades leading up to 1996, rich with advances
and insights of their own, had left no doubt that large
numbers of people in many societies would be ready to
enter under the banner of the Faith. Yet, as encouraging
as instances of large-scale enrolment were, they did not
equate to a sustainable process of growth that could be
cultivated in diverse se�ings. Profound questions faced
the community which, at that time, it had insufficient
experience to answer adequately. How could efforts

2.2

7

aimed at its expansion proceed hand in hand with the
process of consolidation and resolve the long-standing,
seemingly intractable challenge of sustaining growth?
How could individuals, institutions and communities
be raised up that would be capable of translating
Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings into action? And how could
those who were a�racted to the teachings become
protagonists in a global spiritual enterprise?

2.3

So it was that, a quarter of a century ago, a Bahá’í
community that could still count three Hands of the
Cause of God in its front ranks embarked on a Four
Year Plan, distinguished from those that came before it
by its focus on a single aim: a significant advance in the
process of entry by troops. This aim came to define the
series of Plans that followed. The community had
already come to understand that this process was not
just the entry into the Faith of sizeable groups, nor
would it emerge spontaneously; it implied purposeful,
systematic, accelerated expansion and consolidation.
This work would require the informed participation of
a great many souls, and in 1996, the Bahá’í world was
summoned to take up the vast educational challenge
this entailed. It was called to establish a network of
training institutes focused on generating an increasing
flow of individuals endowed with the necessary
capacities to sustain the process of growth.

2.4

The friends set about this task aware that, notwithstanding their previous victories in the teaching
field, plainly they had much to learn about which
capacities to acquire and, crucially, how to acquire

8

them. In many ways, the community would learn by
doing, and the lessons it learned, once they had been
distilled and refined by being applied in diverse
se�ings over time, would eventually be incorporated
into educational materials. It was recognized that
certain activities were a natural response to the
spiritual needs of a population. Study circles, children’s
classes, devotional meetings, and later junior youth
groups stood out as being of central importance in this
regard, and when woven together with related
activities, the dynamics generated could give rise to a
vibrant pa�ern of community life. And as the numbers
participating in these core activities grew, a new
dimension was added to their original purpose. They
came to serve as portals through which youth, adults
and whole families from the wider society could come
into an encounter with the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh. It
was also becoming apparent how practical it was to
consider strategies for the work of community
building within the context of the “cluster”: a
geographic area of manageable size with distinct social
and economic features. A capacity for preparing
simple plans at the level of the cluster began to be
cultivated, and out of such plans, programmes for the
growth of the Faith arose, organized into what would
become three-month cycles of activity. An important
point of clarity emerged early on: the movement of
individuals through a sequence of courses gives
impetus to, and is perpetuated by, the movement of
clusters along a continuum of development. This
complementary relationship helped the friends
everywhere to assess the dynamics of growth in their

9

own surroundings and chart a path towards increased
strength. As time went on, it proved fruitful to view what
was occurring in a cluster both from the perspective of
three educational imperatives—serving children, junior
youth, and youth and adults—as well as from the
perspective of the cycles of activity essential to the
rhythm of growth. Part-way into a twenty-five-year
endeavour, many of the most recognizable features
of the growth process we see today were becoming
well established.

2.5

As the efforts of the friends intensified, various
principles, concepts and strategies of universal
relevance to the growth process began to crystallize
into a framework for action that could evolve to
accommodate new elements. This framework proved
fundamental to the release of tremendous vitality. It
assisted the friends to channel their energies in ways
that, experience had shown, were conducive to the
growth of healthy communities. But a framework is
not a formula. By taking into account the various
elements of the framework when assessing the reality
of a cluster, a locality, or simply a neighbourhood, a
pa�ern of activity could be developed that drew on
what the rest of the Bahá’í world was learning while
still being a response to the particulars of that place. A
dichotomy between rigid requirements on the one
hand and limitless personal preferences on the other
gave way to a more nuanced understanding of the
variety of means by which individuals could support a
process that, at its heart, was coherent and continually
being refined as experience accumulated. Let there be

10

no doubt about the advance represented by the
emergence of this framework: the implications for
harmonizing and unifying the endeavours of the entire
Bahá’í world and propelling its onward march were of
great consequence.
As one Plan succeeded another, and engagement
with the work of community building became more
broadly based, advances at the level of culture became
more pronounced. For instance, the importance of
educating the younger generations became more
widely appreciated, as did the extraordinary potential
represented by junior youth in particular. Souls
assisting and accompanying one another along a
shared path, constantly widening the circle of mutual
support, became the pa�ern to which all efforts aimed
at developing capacity for service aspired. Even the
interactions of the friends among themselves and with
those around them underwent a change, as awareness
was raised of the power of meaningful conversations to
kindle and fan spiritual susceptibilities. And significantly,
Bahá’í communities adopted an increasingly outwardlooking orientation. Any soul responsive to the vision
of the Faith could become an active participant—even
a promoter and facilitator—of educational activities,
meetings for worship and other elements of the
community-building work; from among such souls,
many would also declare their faith in Bahá’u’lláh.
Thus, a conception of the process of entry by troops
emerged that relied less on theories and assumptions
and more on actual experience of how large numbers
of people could find the Faith, become familiar with it,

11

2.6

identify with its aims, join in its activities and
deliberations, and in many cases embrace it. Indeed, as
the institute process was strengthened in region after
region, the number of individuals taking a share in the
work of the Plan, extending even to those recently
acquainted with the Faith, grew by leaps and bounds.
But this was not being driven by a mere concern for
numbers. A vision of personal and collective transformation occurring simultaneously, founded on study
of the Word of God and an appreciation of each
person’s capacity to become a protagonist in a
profound spiritual drama, had given rise to a sense of
common endeavour.

2.7

One of the most striking and inspiring features of
this twenty-five-year period has been the service
rendered by Bahá’í youth, who with faith and valour
have assumed their rightful place in the forefront of the
community’s efforts. As teachers of the Cause and
educators of the young, as mobile tutors and homefront
pioneers, as cluster coordinators and members of Bahá’í
agencies, youth on five continents have arisen to serve
their communities with devotion and sacrifice. The
maturity they have demonstrated, in the discharge of
duties upon which depends the advancement of the
Divine Plan, is expressive of their spiritual vitality and
their commitment to safeguarding humanity’s future. In
recognition of this increasingly evident maturity, we
have decided that, immediately following this Riḍván,
while the age at which a believer becomes eligible to
serve on a Spiritual Assembly shall remain twenty-one,
the age at which a believer may vote in Bahá’í elections

12

shall be lowered to eighteen. We have no doubt that
Bahá’í youth everywhere who are of age will vindicate
our confidence in their ability to fulfil “conscientiously
and diligently” the “sacred duty” to which every
Bahá’í elector is called.
We are conscious that, naturally, the realities
of communities differ greatly. Different national
communities, and different places within those
communities, began this series of Plans at different
points of development; since then, they have also
developed at different speeds and have a�ained
different levels of progress. This, in itself, is nothing
new. It has always been the case that conditions in
places vary, as does the degree of receptivity found
there. But we perceive, too, a swelling tide, whereby
the capacity, confidence and accumulated experience
of most communities are rising, buoyed by the success
of their sister communities near and far. As an
example, while souls who arose to open a new locality
in 1996 lacked nothing for courage, faith and devotion,
today their counterparts everywhere combine those
same qualities with knowledge, insights and skills that
are the accumulation of twenty-five years of effort by
the entire Bahá’í world to systematize and refine the
work of expansion and consolidation.

2.8

Regardless of a community’s starting point, it has
advanced the process of growth when it has combined
qualities of faith, perseverance and commitment with
a readiness to learn. In fact, a cherished legacy of this
series of Plans is the widespread recognition that any

2.9

13

effort to advance begins with an orientation towards
learning. The simplicity of this precept belies the
significance of the implications that follow from it. We
do not doubt that every cluster, given time, will
progress along the continuum of development; the
communities that have advanced most quickly,
relative to those whose circumstances and possibilities
were similar, have shown an ability to foster unity of
thought and to learn about effective action. And they
did so without hesitating to act.

2.10

A commitment to learning also meant being
prepared to make mistakes—and sometimes, of course,
mistakes brought discomfort. Unsurprisingly, new
methods and approaches were handled inexpertly at
first because of a lack of experience; on occasion, a
newly acquired capacity of one kind was lost as a
community became absorbed in developing another.
Having the best of intentions is no guarantee against
making missteps, and moving past them requires both
humility and detachment. When a community has
remained determined to show forbearance and learn
from mistakes that naturally occur, progress has never
been out of reach.

2.11

Midway through the series of Plans, the community’s
involvement in the life of society began to become the
focus of more direct a�ention. The believers were
encouraged to think of this in terms of two interconnected
areas of endeavour—social action and participation in
the prevalent discourses of society. These, of course,
were not alternatives to the work of expansion and

14

consolidation, much less distractions from it: they were
inherent within it. The greater the human resources a
community could call on, the greater became its
capacity to bring the wisdom contained in Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation to bear upon the challenges of the day—to
translate His teachings into reality. And the troubled
affairs of humankind over this period seemed to
underline how desperate was its need for the remedy
prescribed by the Divine Physician. Implied in all this
was a conception of religion very different from those
holding sway in the world at large: a conception which
recognized religion as the potent force propelling an
ever-advancing civilization. It was understood that
such a civilization would also not appear spontaneously,
of its own accord—it was the mission of Bahá’u’lláh’s
followers to labour for its emergence. Such a mission
demanded applying the same process of systematic
learning to the work of social action and engagement
in public discourse.
Viewed from the perspective of the last two and a
half decades, the capacity for undertaking social action
has risen markedly, leading to an extraordinary
efflorescence of activity. Compared with 1996, when
some 250 social and economic development projects
were being sustained from year to year, there are now
1,500, and the number of Bahá’í-inspired organizations
has quadrupled to surpass 160. More than 70,000
grassroots social action initiatives of short duration are
being undertaken each year, a fifty-fold increase. We
look forward to a continued rise in all these endeavours
resulting from the dedicated support and stimulus

15

2.12

now provided by the Bahá’í International Development
Organization. Meanwhile, Bahá’í participation in the
prevalent discourses of society has also grown immensely.
Besides the many occasions when the friends find they
can offer a Bahá’í perspective in conversations that occur
in a work or personal context, more formal participation
in discourses has significantly advanced. We have in
mind not only the much-expanded efforts and
increasingly sophisticated contributions of the Bahá’í
International Community—which in this period added
Offices in Africa, Asia and Europe—but also the work
of a vastly augmented, greatly fortified network of
national Offices of External Affairs, for whom this area
of endeavour became the principal focus; in addition,
there were insightful and notable contributions made by
individual believers to specific fields. All this goes
some way towards explaining the esteem, appreciation
and admiration which leaders of thought and other
prominent figures at all levels of society have again
and again expressed for the Faith, its followers and
their activities.

2.13

In reviewing the entire twenty-five-year period, we
are awed by the many kinds of progress the Bahá’í
world has made concurrently. Its intellectual life has
thrived, as demonstrated not only by its advances in all
the areas of endeavour already discussed, but also by
the volume of high-quality literature published by
Bahá’í authors, by the development of spaces for the
exploration of certain disciplines in the light of the
teachings, and by the impact of the undergraduate and
graduate seminars systematically offered by the

16

Institute for Studies in Global Prosperity, which, in
collaboration with the institutions of the Cause, now
serves Bahá’í youth from well over 100 countries.
Efforts to raise up Houses of Worship have very visibly
accelerated. The last Mother Temple was erected in
Santiago, Chile, and projects to build two national and
five local Mashriqu’l-Adhkárs were initiated; the
Houses of Worship in Ba�ambang, Cambodia, and
Norte del Cauca, Colombia, have already opened their
doors. Bahá’í Temples, whether newly dedicated or
long established, are increasingly occupying a position
at the heart of community life. The material support
offered by the rank and file of the believers for the
myriad endeavours undertaken by the friends of God
has been unstinting. Simply viewed as a measure of
collective spiritual vitality, the generosity and sacrifice
with which, at a time of considerable economic upheaval,
the critical flow of funds has been maintained—nay,
invigorated—is most telling. In the realm of Bahá’í
administration, the capacity of National Spiritual
Assemblies to manage the affairs of their communities
in all their growing complexity has been considerably
enhanced. They have benefited in particular from new
heights of collaboration with the Counsellors, who
have been instrumental in systematizing the gathering
of insights from the grassroots across the world and
ensuring they are widely disseminated. This was also
the period in which the Regional Bahá’í Council
emerged as a fully fledged institution of the Cause, and
in 230 regions now, Councils and those training
institutes they oversee have proved themselves
indispensable for advancing the process of growth. To

17

extend into the future the functions of the Chief
Trustee of Ḥuqúqu’lláh, the Hand of the Cause of God
‘Alí-Muḥammad Varqá, the International Board of
Trustees of Ḥuqúqu’lláh was established in 2005; today
it coordinates the efforts of no less than 33 National
and Regional Boards of Trustees that now compass the
globe, which in turn guide the work of over 1,000
Representatives. The developments which occurred at
the Bahá’í World Centre during this same period are
many: witness the completion of the Terraces of the
Shrine of the Báb and two buildings on the Arc and the
commencement of the construction of the Shrine of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, not to mention a host of projects to
strengthen and preserve the precious Holy Places of
the Faith. The Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and the Shrine of
the Báb were recognized as World Heritage sites,
places of inestimable significance for humanity. The
public flocked to these sacred locations in their
hundreds of thousands, approaching one and a half
million in some years, and the World Centre regularly
welcomed hundreds of pilgrims at once, sometimes
more than 5,000 in a year, along with a similar number
of Bahá’í visitors; we are delighted as much by the
raised numbers as by the scores of different peoples
and nations represented among those who partake of
the bounty of pilgrimage. The translation, publication
and dissemination of the Sacred Texts has also been
greatly accelerated, in parallel with the development of
the Bahá’í Reference Library, one of the most notable
members of the growing family of websites associated
with Bahai.org, which itself is now available in ten
languages. A variety of offices and agencies have been

18

established, situated at the World Centre and elsewhere,
charged with supporting the process of learning
unfolding across multiple areas of endeavour
throughout the Bahá’í world. All this, our sisters and
brothers in faith, is but a fraction of the tale we could
recount of what your devotion to Him Who was the
Wronged One of the World has brought forth. We can
but echo the poignant words once voiced by the
beloved Master when, overcome with emotion, He
cried out: “O Bahá’u’lláh! What hast Thou done?”

*
From the panorama of a pivotal quarter century,
we now direct our focus to the most recent Five Year
Plan, a Plan quite unlike any that has gone before in a
variety of ways. In this Plan we urged the Bahá’ís of the
world to draw on all that they had learned in the
previous twenty years and put it to full effect. We are
delighted that our hopes in this regard were more than
met, but while we would naturally expect great things
from the followers of the Blessed Beauty, the character
of what was achieved through their herculean efforts
was truly breathtaking. It was the capstone to an
accomplishment twenty-five years in the making.

2.14

The Plan was especially memorable for being trisected
by two sacred bicentenaries, each of which galvanized
local communities the world over. The company of the
faithful demonstrated, on a scale never previously
witnessed and with relative ease, a capacity to engage
people from all sections of society in honouring the life

2.15

19

of a Manifestation of God. It was a powerful indicator
of something broader: the ability to channel the release
of tremendous spiritual energies for the advancement
of the Cause. So magnificent was the response that in
many places the Faith was propelled out of obscurity at
the national level. In se�ings where it was unexpected,
perhaps unlooked for, marked receptivity to the Faith
became apparent. Thousands upon thousands upon
thousands were transported by their encounter with a
devotional spirit that is today characteristic of Bahá’í
communities everywhere. The vision of what is made
possible by observing a Bahá’í Holy Day was
immeasurably expanded.

2.16

The achievements of the Plan, simply in numerical
terms, quickly eclipsed those of all the Plans that had
preceded it since 1996. At the start of this Plan, the
capacity existed for conducting just over 100,000 core
activities at a given time, a capacity that was the fruit
of twenty years of common endeavour. Now, 300,000
core activities are being sustained at once. Participation
in those activities has risen above two million, which is
also close to a threefold increase. There are 329 national
and regional training institutes in operation, and their
capacity is evidenced by the fact that three-quarters of
a million people have been enabled to complete at least
one book of the sequence; overall, the number of
courses completed by individuals is now also two
million—a rise of well over a third in five years.

2.17

The increased intensity with which programmes of
growth around the world are being pursued tells an

20

impressive story of its own. In this five-year span, we
had called for growth to be accelerated in every one of
the 5,000 clusters where it had begun. This imperative
became the impetus for earnest endeavour throughout
the world. As a result, the number of intensive
programmes of growth more than doubled and now
stands at approximately 4,000. Difficulties involved in
opening up new villages and neighbourhoods to the
Faith in the midst of a global health crisis, or
expanding activities that were at an early stage when
the pandemic began, prevented an even higher total
from being reached during the Plan’s final year.
However, there is more to tell than this. At the outset of
the Plan, we had expressed the hope that the number
of clusters where the friends had passed the third
milestone along a continuum of growth, as a consequence
of learning how to welcome large numbers into the
embrace of their activities, would grow by hundreds
more. That total then stood at around 200, spread
across some 40 countries. Five years on, this number
has risen to an astonishing 1,000 in nearly 100
countries—a quarter of all the intensive programmes of
growth in the world and an achievement far surpassing
our expectations. And yet even these figures do not
reveal the loftiest heights to which the community has
soared. There are over 30 clusters where the number of
core activities being sustained exceeds 1,000; in places,
the total is several thousand, involving the
participation of more than 20,000 people in a single
cluster. A growing number of Local Spiritual Assemblies
now oversee the unfoldment of educational programmes
that cater to practically all the children and junior

21

youth in a village; the same reality is beginning to
emerge within a few urban neighbourhoods.
Engagement with the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh has, in
notable instances, transcended individuals, families
and extended kinships—what is being witnessed is the
movement of populations towards a common centre.
At times, age-old hostilities between opposing groups
are being left behind, and certain social structures and
dynamics are being transformed in the light of the
divine teachings.

2.18

We cannot but be overjoyed at advances so
impressive. The society-building power of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh is being manifested with ever more clarity,
and this is a firm foundation upon which the coming
Nine Year Plan will build. Clusters of marked strength,
as had been hoped, have proven to be reservoirs of
knowledge and resources for their neighbours. And
regions where more than one such cluster exist have
more easily developed the means to accelerate growth
in cluster after cluster. We feel compelled to stress
again, however, that progress has been near universal;
the difference in progress between one place and
another is of degree. The community’s collective
understanding of the process of entry by troops and its
confidence in being able to stimulate this process
under any set of circumstances have risen to levels that
were unimaginable in decades past. The profound
questions that had loomed for so long, and which were
brought into sharp focus in 1996, have been convincingly
answered by the Bahá’í world. There is a generation of
believers whose entire lives bear the imprint of the

22

community’s progress. But the sheer scale of what has
occurred in those many clusters where the frontiers of
learning are being extended has turned a significant
advance in the process of entry by troops into a
momentous one of historic proportions.
Many will be familiar with how the Guardian
divided the Ages of the Faith into consecutive epochs;
the fifth epoch of the Formative Age began in 2001.
Less well known is that the Guardian also made
specific reference to there being epochs of the Divine
Plan, and stages within those epochs. Held in abeyance
for two decades while local and national organs of the
Administrative Order were being raised up and
strengthened, the Divine Plan conceived by ‘Abdu’lBahá was formally inaugurated in 1937 with the
commencement of the first stage of its first epoch: the
Seven Year Plan assigned by the Guardian to the North
American Bahá’í community. This first epoch closed
after the conclusion of the Ten Year Crusade in 1963,
which had resulted in the banner of the Faith being
planted across the world. The opening stage of the
second epoch was the first Nine Year Plan, and no less
than ten Plans have followed in its wake, Plans that
have ranged in duration from twelve months to seven
years. At the dawn of this second epoch, the Bahá’í
world was already witnessing the earliest beginnings
of that entry into the Faith by troops that had been
foreseen by the Author of the Divine Plan; in the
succeeding decades, generations of devoted believers
within the community of the Greatest Name have
laboured in the Divine Vineyard to cultivate the

23

2.19

conditions required for sustained, large-scale growth.
And at this glorious season of Riḍván, how abundant
are the fruits of those labours! The phenomenon of
sizeable numbers swelling the activities of the
community, catching the spark of faith and swiftly
arising to serve at the leading edge of the Plan has
moved from being a forecast sustained by faith to a
recurring reality. Such a pronounced and demonstrable
advance demands to be marked in the annals of the
Cause. With elated hearts, we announce that the third
epoch of the Master’s Divine Plan has begun. Stage by
stage, epoch after epoch shall His Plan unfold, until the
light of the Kingdom illumines every heart.

Beloved friends, no review of the five-year enterprise
that concluded the second epoch of the Divine Plan
would be complete without special reference to the
upheavals that accompanied its final year and which
persist still. The restrictions on personal interaction
that waxed and waned in most countries over this
period could have dealt the community’s collective
efforts a severe blow, recovery from which might have
taken years, but there are two reasons why this was not
the case. One was the widespread consciousness of the
duty of Bahá’ís to serve humanity, never more so than
in times of peril and adversity. The other was the
extraordinary rise in capacity in the Bahá’í world to
give expression to that consciousness. Accustomed
over many years to adopting pa�erns of systematic
action, the friends brought their creativity and sense of

24

purpose to bear on an unforeseen crisis, while
ensuring that the new approaches they developed
were coherent with the framework they had laboured
in successive Plans to perfect. This is not to overlook
the serious hardships being endured by Bahá’ís, like
their compatriots in every land; yet throughout severe
difficulties, the believers have remained focused.
Resources have been channelled to communities in
need, elections went ahead wherever possible, and in
all circumstances the institutions of the Cause have
continued to discharge their duties. There have even
been bold steps forward. The National Spiritual
Assembly of São Tomé and Príncipe will be reestablished this Riḍván, and two new pillars of the
Universal House of Justice will be raised up: the
National Spiritual Assembly of Croatia, with its seat in
Zagreb, and the National Spiritual Assembly of TimorLeste, with its seat in Dili.
And so the One Year Plan begins. Its purpose and
requirements have already been set out in our message
sent on the Day of the Covenant; this Plan, though
brief, will suffice to prepare the Bahá’í world for the
Nine Year Plan that is to follow. A period of special
potency, which opened one hundred years after the
revelation of the Tablets of the Divine Plan, will soon
close with the centenary of the Ascension of ‘Abdu’lBahá, marking the conclusion of the first century of the
Formative Age and the start of the second. The
company of the faithful enter this new Plan at a time
when humanity, chastened by the exposure of its
vulnerability, seems more conscious of the need for

25

2.21

collaboration to address global challenges. Yet, lingering
habits of contest, self-interest, prejudice and closedmindedness continue to hinder the movement towards
unity, despite growing numbers in society who are
showing in words and deeds how they, too, yearn for
greater acceptance of humanity’s inherent oneness. We
pray that the family of nations may succeed in pu�ing
aside its differences in the interests of the common
good. Notwithstanding the uncertainties that shroud
the months aheade entreat Bahá’u’lláh to make the
confirmations that have sustained His followers for so
long more abundant still, that you may be carried
forward in your mission, your composure undisturbed
by the turbulence of a world whose need for His
healing message is ever more acute.

2.22

The Divine Plan enters a new epoch and a new
stage. The page is turned.
